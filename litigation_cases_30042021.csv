The Mapuche Confederation of Neuquén brought a criminal complaint asserting that the mishandling of toxic waste has resulted in contamination that threatens the environment and public health. The complaint discusses a United Nations report that called on the Argentine government to reconsider the decision to allow fracking in the Vacca Muerta because of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas development. The complaint seeks a criminal investigation into the waste sites, and names the Argentine energy company YPF, Total, Exxon, Pan American Energy, Pampa Energia, the Secretary of Territorial and Environmental Development, the Subsecretary of the Environment, the Provision Director of Environmental Situations and Special Residuals Management, and the Provincial Budget Director.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Hunter Environment Lobby objected to the proposal, notably on the ground that the extensions would have an important impact on climate change. Nevertheless, the project was approved by the Planning Minister in November 2010 and the Hunter Environment Lobby appealed. In its decision, the Court distinguished between direct GHG emissions (Scope 1 GHG emissions) and indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2 GHG emissions), i.e. emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity. With respect to direct emissions, the Court held that it was lawful and reasonably implementable to take them into account in the approval process. The Court further highlighted that it was not discriminatory to do so as upcoming approvals would follow the same rule. However, the Court refused to impose any condition with respect to indirect emissions. The Court thus affirmed the approval, but subject to certain conditions, including a condition which required the offset of any direct GHG emissions from the mine. This condition could be suspended if another law or regulation was introduced which would cover these emissions. 


Following this initial decision, the Australian Government introduced a carbon price, which was implemented through federal legislation.  In light of this new scheme, in a subsequent decision the Court held that it was valid for the Minister to decide that the condition on the mine relating to offsetting of direct emissions was no longer necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Federal Court of Australia summarily dismissed the appeal, finding that the appellant had no reasonable prospect of success because the laws did not effect or authorize the acquisition of the appellant's property. On appeal, the Full Court upheld the dismissal. The appellant appealed again to the High Court of Australia, which found that the proceeding should not have been dismissed because the possibility remained that the laws are invalid due to the informal arrangement between the State and the Commonwealth. The Federal Court rejected Spencer's claim in 2015, after holding a full trial and concluding that there was no ""informal agreement"" between New South Wales and the Commonwealth and that the laws prohibiting Spencer from clearing native vegetation did not thereby effect an ""acquisition"" of his property. Spencer has appealed.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defendant Macquarie Generation's motion for summary dismissal was denied on March 22, 2010, although Justice Pain did dismiss the applicant's case in part. The court found that even if Defendant has an implied authority to emit some amount of carbon dioxide in generating electricity under its license, that authority is limited to an amount which has reasonable regard and care for people and the environment. 


Macquarie appealed the court's finding that it was subject to implied CO2 emissions limits.  The implicit conditions were based on common law principles that require prevention of emissions in excess of levels that could be achieved by exercising ""reasonable regard and care for the interests of others and the environment."" The court of appeals reversed the lower court's decision, reasoning that these common law principles only protected private rights (such as a nuisance claim) and were not applicable to a permit granted under a statute.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the principal issues related to potential flooding and the decision is the first to apply the State Coastal Planning Policy anticipating a 0.38 meter increase in sea level due to climate change. The Tribunal determined that the development application warranted conditional approval. With respect to potential flooding, the Tribunal found that the level of the water table over the lifetime of the development, including anticipated increase in the water table due to sea level rise by 2100, would not compromise the structural stability of the building or cause water ingress. Thus, the proposal did not warrant refusal because of potential for flooding. The development application was approved subject to 40 conditions including conditions to ensure that the development is carried out in a manner that is appropriate having regard to heritage and amenity considerations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Tribunal has received a number of statements of grounds from residents and others expressing concern about the visual impact of the dwelling; the impact upon native vegetation; the impact of the accessway upon the Surry River floodway; the threat to bird and small mammal species and Aboriginal middens; and the appropriateness of the dwelling having regard to climate change, the Victorian Coastal Strategy (VCS) and Glenelg's Strategic Futures Plan (SFP). As part of its decision VCAT considered Clause 13.01-1 of the State Planning Policy, which requires authorities to manage and plan for the possible coastal impacts of climate change [at 70] including the possibility of a 'sea level rise of not less than 0.8 metres by 2100'. This requirement was interpreted by VCAT to mean that authorities may consider sea level rises that are greater than 0.8 metres. Whether such a consideration ?is appropriate will depend upon the circumstances of the particular site, the nature of the proposal and the scientific information available at the time. Clause 13.01-1 also calls for an application of ?the precautionary principle to planning and management decision-making when considering the risks associated with climate change.' In this case, despite accepting that the risk of coastal impacts at the site was low, the Tribunal held that the primary dune system and the estuary remained vulnerable to the affects of climate change. The Tribunal further stated that the Victorian Coastal Strategy cautioned against development that would compromise future ability to adapt to the impacts of climate change and respond to emerging climate science The Tribunal also took into account the following points in rejecting the issue of a permit: the location of the proposed site was undesirable, being on the slope of a primary sand dune; the dwelling did not maintain or enhance the coastal landscape character of the area; the site's capacity for on-site containment of domestic wastewater was not satisfactorily demonstrated; the site access required would significantly disturb a wetland; the dwelling wouldn't blend into the surrounding landscape and would occupy an effective buffer space that protected the town.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plaintiffs alleged that the need for those protections and the cause of the properties' partial loss of value was the fault of the Council. In the 1960s and 70s, the Council constructed a form of hard shoreline armoring—""an artificial headland protected by a rock seawall."" Then, between 2006 and 2010, the Council issued draft planning documents (i) prohibiting the plaintiffs from armoring their own segments of shoreline and (ii) proposing a policy of managed retreat in response to rising seas and an encroaching shoreline. The Coastal Protection Act provides that such plans only become final and effective after approval by the New South Wales Minister for Planning; the Council withdrew its draft Coastal Zone Management Plan in May 2011, before the Minister considered it. Plaintiffs presented two alternative theories in support of their claim: either that the Council was negligent for installing hard shoreline armoring that has since displaced wave action to plaintiffs' adjacent portions of beach, worsening erosion there; or that the council's armoring constitutes an instance of public nuisance. Plaintiffs also argued that their injury was compounded by the Council's issuance and withdrawal of planning documents, and persistent position that managed retreat is the preferred policy response to shoreline encroachment. After the plaintiffs' suit survived a motion to dismiss in March 2016, the Council's insurers, who had been steering the defense in the case, agreed to a settlement. As a result, the court never determined legal liability for the claims alleged. The settlement's terms bar the Council from removing existing coastal armoring (chiefly rock, concrete, and rubble barriers) on the plaintiffs' parcels unless the plaintiffs agree to such removal. Should plaintiffs want to add to that armoring, the must apply within one year of the settlement, dated August 2016, and then must make the requested additions within one year of approval of their application. Any subsequent repairs or additions may only be proposed after 20 years, and the Council has not guaranteed that such proposals would be approved.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

By refusing to review the Queensland Supreme Court's decision in Coast and Country Association of Queensland Inc v. Smith, the High Court of Australia effectively resolved a question about this review process, namely how to interpret the emissions of coal burned by the end-user of Australian coal. Environmentalists have long argued that even though coal emissions are remote from the mine, they should be considered in EIAs because they are a foreseeable result of mining and would not necessarily occur if the coal were not dug out of an Australian mine. The opposing view holds that coal combustion is physically remote from mining operations, that demand rather than supply drives the market for coal (meaning that mining more Australian coal does not necessarily cause more emissions globally), and that the Environmental Protection Act therefore does not require consideration of coal combustion emissions in EIAs for mines. The Coast and Country decision adopts the latter view. The High Court has not, by refusing to review the Supreme Court of Queensland's decision, endorsed that court's reasoning, but it has indicated that it will not take up cases challenging the conclusion in Coast and Country regarding the proper scope of a mine's EIA. Legally, the basis for that conclusion relates to lower courts' responsibility for determining factual questions, such as the scope of coal mining operations and the nature of the market for coal. Practically, that conclusion means that environmentalists cannot expect to persuade Queensland courts that the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld) requires consideration of whether a new coal mine will increase global greenhouse gas emissions.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Tribunal evaluated arguments relating to each of 11 contested documents and ultimately concluded that the interest of the public weighed on both sides of the case: the public had an interest in knowing how the Victorian and federal governments had negotiated issues related to climate change policy; but the public also had an interest in the Victorian government's staff being free to deliberate without concern that those deliberations should be public.

Melbourne Water, the regional flood manager, had indicated that it did not object to the project, provided the ground floor was elevated to an adequate height. The core issue for the Tribunal was whether a coastal hazard vulnerability assessment—which would specify the nature and degree of risk arising from sea level rise and related flooding—was prerequisite to the council's review of the building application. Noting a recent change in state planning policy and observing that ""coastal hazard vulnerability assessments will too become more routine in the planning process,"" the Tribunal upheld the council's refusal and instructed Owen to commission an assessment before resubmitting his application.


The same parties again came before the Tribunal after Owen commissioned an assessment.

The amended complaint alleges that a prudent superannuation trustee would have, among other things, required its investment managers to provide the type of information that McVeigh requested regarding climate change; and ensure that its processes for managing investments and disclosing climate change business risks to beneficiaries complied with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In January 2019 the court issued an order on plaintiff's application for maximum costs, which is a mechanism to allow individuals bringing cases in the public interest to avoid legal costs.

The Land &amp; Environment Court of New South Wales upheld the government's denial of the application. The court found that the project was not in the public interest after weighing costs and benefits of the project, including the climate change impacts of the mine's direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. Under Section 4.15(1) of the Environmental Planning &amp; Assessment Act (the EPA), the government is to consider the public interest as part of its review of a development application. The Department of Planning denied the Rocky Hill Coal Project application in December 2017.&nbsp;<br><br>After Gloucester Resources Limited appealed the decision, a local community action group called Gloucester Groundswell Inc. was joined to the litigation. The Minister and Groundswell argued that the Rocky Hill Project application should be denied due to the: 1) incompatibility of the proposed mine with the existing, approved and likely preferred uses of nearby land; 2) the adverse visual impacts of the mine; 3) the adverse social impacts of the mine; 4) the uncertainty surrounding the economic and public benefits of the mine which were not shown to be greater than the public costs of the mine; and 5) the Rocky Hill Coal Project is not in the public interest because of the matters in (1) to (4) above and ""it is contrary to the principles of ecologically sustainable development because the direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions of the mine will contribute to climate change."" As part of its consideration of climate change impacts, the court held that both upstream and downstream emissions of the project should be considered by the Planning Department because the EPA and its regulations require consideration of ""the principles of ecologically sustainable development"" (""ESD"") which can encompass climate change impacts. The court also pointed to the requirements under the EPA to consider ""any environmental planning instrument"" and cited language in the State Environmental Planning Policy (Mining, Petroleum Production and Extractive Industries) of 2009 and the 2010 Gloucester Local Environmental Plan as including consideration of ESD and the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions associated with a project.&nbsp;<br><br>The court recognized the link between these emissions and climate change, remaining unpersuaded by petitioner's arguments related to market substitution, carbon leakage, the theoretical possibility that other projects would offset these emissions, and the inefficiency of this denial as a mechanism for global abatement of emissions. After weighing the costs and benefits of the project, the court upheld the government's denial of the application, finding ""that the negative impacts of the Project, including the planning impacts on the existing, approved and likely preferred land uses, the visual impacts, the amenity impacts of noise and dust that cause social impacts, other social impacts, and climate change impacts, outweigh the economic and other public benefits of the Project."" While not foreclosing all mining projects, the court ruled that this project was not a ""sustainable use"" because of the combination of climate change impacts of the project and the high environmental and social costs of locating a coal mine in this particular location. Gloucester Resources Limited did not file an appeal by the court-designated deadline of May 8, 2019.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The implicit conditions were based on common law principles that require prevention of emissions in excess of levels that could be achieved by exercising ""reasonable regard and care for the interests of others and the environment.""

There is a prohibition upon the taking of action that has, will have, or is likely to have a significant impact on the environment. The ACF claimed that the Minister made an error of law in failing to consider the effect of emissions from transport by rail, shipping, and combustion of the product coal overseas, in characterising these emissions as “not a direct consequence of the proposed action,” and in failing to consider or apply the precautionary principle in relation to the possible impacts on relevant matters of national environmental significance. The court upheld the lower court’s findings that the Minister’s reasons reflected a proper discharge of his statutory duty in a judgement issued on August 25, 2017.<br><br></div><div>However, in a judgement issued December 15, 2017, the Court accepted that matters concerning the Reef and climate change were important to Australians.

The protesters blocked a railway line that provides access to a coal loading facility by using tubular steel attachment devices to ""lock"" themselves to a 44 gallon drum filled with concrete, creating a device known as a ""dragon's den."" The devices can only be released voluntarily, or if someone else cuts the device, and cutting the device risks injury to the protesters. The defendants were charged with obstructing a railway; trespassing on a railway; using a dangerous attachment device to interfere with transport infrastructure; and contravening a direction or requirement. The dangerous attachment device offense was a new offense created by 2019 legislation that prohibits the use of devices such as ""dragon dens,"" which was introduced in response to protests against coal mining and regarding climate change. The Acting Magistrate convicted and sentenced the defendants to three months imprisonment for that offense. Convictions were not recorded for the other offenses.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On appeal, the district court concluded that the device the protesters used fell within the definition of a ""dragon's den,"" but that the gravity of the offense was minimal given the lack of evidence that any loss was suffered, that members of the public were burdened, or that there was violence or the threat of violence. The court further explained that the defendants ""have the right to express their views and to protest against an activity to which they object subject only to such restrictions as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for (amongst other legitimate aims) the prevention of disorder or crime or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others,"" and that ""the motive for the commission of the offen[s]e will often be relevant to the moral culpability of the offender, the weight to given to personal deterrence and it may affect the weight to be given to general deterrence.""

Of the authorities cited by the court, the most important was Austria's Climate Protection Act of 2011, which set emissions reduction targets for various sectors, including the transport sector. Because a third runway was expected to increase Austria's annual CO2 emissions, the court concluded that it would be at odds with the provisions of the 2011 Act as well as with Austria's constitution and its international commitments under EU law and the Paris Agreement.&nbsp;<br><br>The Austrian Constitutional Court overturned the Federal Administrative Court's decision in June 2017, citing multiple errors that led the lower court to improperly give weight to climate change and land use considerations in the balancing test it used to consider the public's interest in a third runway.

In arriving at its decision, the Court acknowledged the appellants' argument that burning cane does not add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere on a net basis over a multi-year timeframe, because it only releases gases absorbed by the cane over the prior 12-18 months. The Court pointed out, however, that burning released in less than an hour greenhouse gases that were absorbed over the course of a year or more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The court denied the challenge, finding that the regulations were a valid exercise of government authority as part of an overall strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. After hearing Syncrude's appeal, the appellate court characterized its key argument as follows:


Syncrude was asking the Court to substitute its view for that of the [government] as to whether the [renewable fuel requirement]s could, in the language of [Canadian Environmental Policy Act] subsection 140(2), ""make a significant contribution to the prevention of, or reduction in, air pollution.""
 
The Court of Appeal rejected this argument, concluding not only that the government's premise is warranted but furthermore that, ""[e]ven if there was a solid evidentiary foundation establishing a different scientific opinion . . . it would not detract from the [government] forming a different opinion on admittedly different evidence.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

The court found this approach would exceed the constitutional authority of Parliament and intrude too far into areas of Provincial authority and limit Provincial efforts to deal with GHG emissions. However, the Court did rule that Parliament has more narrow authority under the POGG to establish ""minimum national standards of price stringency for GHG emissions"" because this authority ""has the singleness, distinctiveness and indivisibility required by the law.""

The Court wrote that ""Canada has adduced evidence that clearly shows that establishing minimum national standards of GHG price stringency to reduce GHG emissions is of sufficient concern to Canada as a whole that it warrants consideration in accordance with the national concern doctrine."" Provinces were incapable of addressing the problem in the same way because they could not set a national minimum GHG price, and ""a failure to include one province in the scheme would jeopardize its success in the rest of Canada.""

In May 2019, the Ontario Legislature enacted the Federal Carbon Tax Transparency Act, which required that a notice explaining certain fuel charges be posted on every gas pump in every gas station in Ontario. The notice stated ""the federal carbon tax will cost you,"" with a graph showing costs to consumers rising through 2022.

The Court then concluded that the required notice adversely affected expression. Moreover, the Court reasoned, the notice was ""inaccurate in a way that the Ontario government well knows"" because the carbon pricing act serves a regulatory rather than a revenue-raising purpose, and so it is not a tax. Finally, the Court held that the notice's infringement on free speech was not justified because it served more to advance a partisan message than to share information with the public.

In plaintiffs' view, this target -- which is less ambitious than previously adopted targets -- is inadequate. Plaintiffs assert a genuine interest in preventing catastrophic climate change that poses pervasive and serious risks to the health and wellbeing of their generation and future generations of Ontarians. Their claims arise under sections 7 and 15 of the Charter, which provide the right to life, liberty and security of the person; and equal protection under the law, respectively.<br><br></div><div>Plaintiffs seek, among other things, a declaration that Ontario's target violates the rights of Ontario youth and future generations under sections 7 and 15 of the Charter; a declaration that Ontario's target violates an unwritten constitutional principle that governments may not engage in conduct that will, or unreasonably could be expected to, result in the future harm, suffering or death of a significant number of its own citizens; a declaration that section 7 of the Charter includes the right to a stable climate system, capable of providing youth and future generations with a sustainable future; a declaration that sections 3(1) and/or 16 of the Cap and Trade Cancellation Act, which repealed the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016, and allowed for the imposition of more lenient targets without mandating that they be set according to the Paris Agreement's goals or any sort of science-based process, violates sections 7 and 15 of the Charter; an order that Ontario set a science-based greenhouse gas reduction target that is consistent with Ontario's share of the minimum level of greenhouse gas reductions necessary to limit global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius or well below 2 degrees Celsius; and an order directing Ontario to revise is climate change plan once it has set such a target.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on April 15, arguing that the Charter does not guarantee a right to a stable climate, the plaintiffs lack standing to represent future generations, the plaintiffs have shown no reasonable cause of action, and the plaintiffs cannot prove their allegations.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On November 12, 2020, the Superior Court Justice rejected the motion to dismiss on the grounds that it not plain and obvious that the plaintiffs present no reasonable cause of action.

The court noted several important features of paramos, including their fragility, their lack of regulatory protection, their role in providing Colombia with as much as 70 percent of its drinking water, and the capacity of their soils and vegetation to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The court highlighted the last of these features in particular, calling pa?ramos a ""carbon capture system"" and explaining that a paramos' carbon capture capacity exceeds that of a comparably-sized tropical rainforest. Law No. 1450 of 2011 established Colombia's National Development Plan 2010–2014, and Law No. 1753 of 2015 established its 2014–2018 successor. Two provisions in the latter law are especially notable here. The first of these authorizes the Commission on Intersectoral Infrastructure and Strategic Projects to designate particular projects as being in the national strategic interest—a designation that exempts projects from aspects of local regulatory oversight. The second provision prohibits various activities—agriculture, mining, oil and gas exploration and refining—in paramos, but only if project owners received a lease and environmental permit for mining after February 9, 2010 or for oil and gas operations after June16, 2011. Thus the law authorizes projects that received permits prior to those dates. The Court declared both of these provisions (and others) unconstitutional for, among other things, endangering the public's right to clean water, and relieving government agencies of their obligation to justify decisions certain to result in the degradation of environmentally sensitive and valuable areas.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,

The support scheme provided direct income support to farmers, however it was amended such that all direct payments beyond a certain amount should be reduced by a certain percentage each year.  The savings made through these reductions would then be used to finance measures under the rural development policy, in light of the ""new and demanding challenges"" faced by the agriculture sector, ""such as climate change and the increasing importance of bio-energy, as well as the need for better water management and more effective protection of biodiversity.""

The Court reviewed two issues: (1) whether a new provision to the Regulation to reduce the amount of direct payments to farmers was valid, against an existing provision that already set the amount, in light of the principle of protecting legitimate expectations; (2) and whether a four percent increase for farmers with larger holdings exceeding 300,000 euros violates the principle of non-discrimination.

Several features of the ETS are critical to the case: some allowances are auctioned to emitters and others are given away for free; there are a fixed proportion of free allowances, which are granted only to firms that face competition from non-EU firms a category that excludes electricity generators; the process for calculating the number of allowances ""auctioned and free"" begins with member states' submission of emission sources and estimated volumes; responding to members states' overestimation of the allowances due to their industrial firms, the European Commission issued Decisions in 2011 and 2013 to govern the calculation of a ""correction factor.""&nbsp;<br><br>The Court found that the European Commission's 2013 Decision established a ""correction factor"" calculation that ignored relevant information, and on that basis instructed the Commission to revise its approach by March 2017.

Nordzucker's emissions report excluded emissions resulting from steam generation necessary to operate the refinery's drying facility on the basis of a letter from a German Ministry stating that such facilities were exempted from compulsory emissions trading schemes. An expert verified the report, and Nordzucker surrendered emissions allowances equal to the emissions stated in the report. Subsequently, the German Emissions Trading Authority examined Nordzucker's emissions report and found that it should have included emissions attributable to the refinery's drying facility. Nordzucker revised its emissions report and surrendered additional allowances. German authorities found Nordzucker liable for failing to timely surrender emissions allowances and levied a penalty as provided in Article 16(3) of Directive 2003/87. After a series of appeals, the German Federal Administrative Court referred to the European Court of Justice the question whether excess emissions penalties apply where an operator surrenders allowances equal to emissions stated in a verified report, but where the report is later found to understate the operator's emissions and additional allowances are surrendered.

Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, the Court decided to reopen the oral procedure and called on the parties to set out their views on the possible consequences to be drawn from that fact and, in particular, from the entry into force of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU in the context of the present proceedings.&nbsp;<br><br>In the context of an action for damages seeking compensation for the damage allegedly suffered by the applicant in consequence of the adoption of that directive, the Court held that the Community legislature enjoys broad discretion when exercising its powers in the field of environmental issues under Article 174 EC and Article 175 EC. The exercise of that discretionary power implies the need for the Community legislature to anticipate and evaluate ecological, scientific, technical and economic changes of a complex and uncertain nature and the weighing up and arbitration by that legislature of the various objectives, principles and interests set out in Article 174 EC. That is reflected in Directive 2003/87/EC in the establishment of a series of objectives and sub-objectives which are in part contradictory. When the Community legislature is called on to restructure or establish a complex scheme, such as the allowance trading scheme, it is entitled to have recourse to a step-by-step approach and to carry out only a progressive harmonisation of the national legislation at issue.&nbsp;<br><br>The Court stressed that, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity, European Union legislation in the sphere of environmental protection does not seek to effect complete harmonisation, the Member States being free to adopt more stringent protective measures, subject only to the conditions that those be compatible with the EC Treaty and be notified to the Commission. The mere fact that the Community legislature left open a particular question falling within the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC and of a fundamental freedom does not in itself justify that omission's being classified as contrary to the rules of the Treaty. In addition, the implementation of Directive 2003/87/EC being subject to review by the national courts, it is incumbent upon those courts, if they should encounter difficulties relating to the interpretation or validity of that directive, to refer a question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. Last, the applicant claimed that Directive 2003/87/EC infringes the principle of legal certainty, because there is no provision governing the extent of the financial consequences which may result from both a possible insufficiency of allowances allocated to an installation and the price of those allowances, that price being determined exclusively by the market forces which came into being following the establishment of the allowance trading scheme.&nbsp;<br><br>The Court found that regulation of the prices of allowances might thwart the main objective of Directive 2003/87/EC, which is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through an efficient allowance trading scheme in which the cost of emissions and investments made to reduce such emissions is essentially determined by market forces. In the event of an insufficiency of allowances, the incentive for operators to reduce, or not to reduce, their greenhouse gas emissions will depend on a complex economic decision taken in the light of the price of emission allowances available on the exchange market and of the costs of possible measures to reduce emissions which may aim either to reduce production or to invest in more efficient methods of production in terms of energy output.<br><br>In such a scheme, the increase in the cost of emissions cannot be regulated in advance by the legislature without reducing, or even completely removing, the economic incentives which constitute its very basis and thereby adversely affecting the effectiveness of the allowance trading scheme. The fact that it is not possible to predict how the exchange market will develop constitutes an element inherent in and inseparable from the economic mechanism characterising the allowance trading scheme subject to the classic rules of supply and demand and cannot be contrary to the principle of legal certainty.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

On 7 July 2004, the Commission adopted Decision C(2004) 2515/4 final concerning the national allocation plan for the allocation of greenhouse gas emission allowances notified by the United Kingdom. Subsequently, the United Kingdom notified the Commission that it wished to amend its NAP. The United Kingdom proposed, in particular, to increase the total quantity of allowances to 756.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. However, the Commission indicated that it considered that the proposed amendments were inadmissible. The United Kingdom applied to the Court of First Instance requesting the infringement of the Directive and of the Decision of 7 July 2004. It stated that the NAP in question was expressly provisional and that this had been acknowledged by the Commission. The Commission contested that it had been of the view that the NAP, including the figures relating to the total quantity of allowances, had been complete. The Commission added that any amendment exceeding the total quantity of allowances was expressly excluded as Commission decisions on NAPs had to provide certainty, both for the coherence of the emissions trading system overall and in order for the allowance market to function properly, as market price building depended strongly on the utmost stability of the total quantity of allowances. Otherwise, the risk of having a series of consultations and new Commission decisions would arise. The market for allowances, being reliant on the stability of the total quantity of allowances, would be undermined and unable to function properly with such a degree of uncertainty. The court noted that in the contested decision, the Commission rejected as inadmissible the amendments of the NAP proposed by the United Kingdom because they would have resulted in the total quantity of allocated quotas exceeding the quantity authorized by the Commission in its Decision of 7 July 2004. Therefore, the Commission did not consider itself obliged to carry out any examination of the proposed amendments on their merits. In order to decide whether the Commission was entitled to reject those amendments as inadmissible, the court examined the roles and powers allocated to the Commission and the Member States respectively under the Directive, particularly those in Articles 9, 10 and 11. It concluded that the amendments of the NAP were not limited in the way expressed by the Commission. This followed necessarily from the fact that the Member State was obliged, in accordance with Article 11(1) of and paragraph 9 of Annex III to the Directive, to take account of comments received from the public after the initial notification of the NAP and before the adoption of the definitive decision under Article 11(1) of the Directive. If amendments to the NAPs, made after the expiry of the three-month period mentioned in Article 9(3) of the Directive or after a decision of the Commission, were limited in the way described by the Commission, then that public consultation would be deprived of its effectiveness and the comments of the public would be rendered purely academic. It also had to be pointed out that the purpose of the Directive was to establish an efficient European market in greenhouse gas emission allowances, with the least possible diminution of economic development and employment. Therefore, even though the Directive aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, that aim had to be achieved, in so far as possible, while respecting the needs of the European economy. It followed that the NAPs developed under the Directive had to take due account of accurate data relating to emission forecasts for the installations covered by the Directive. If a NAP was based in part on incorrect information relating to the level of emissions in certain sectors, the Member State in question would have to be entitled to propose amendments to the NAP, including increases to the total quantity of allowances to be allocated, in order to address those problems before the market began functioning. The Court therefore considered that it followed both from the wording of the Directive, and from the general structure and objectives of the system which it establishes, that the Commission could not restrict a Member State's right to propose amendments. The Commission also maintained that any amendment increasing the total quantity of allowances had to be excluded because it could have an adverse effect on the stability of the market. The Court considered that this argument has not been substantiated by the Commission. The argument of the Commission that the proposed amendments would have serious repercussions on scarcity and would therefore be likely to have a significant impact on the market price was exaggerated. The United Kingdom proposed to increase the total quantity of allowances from 736 to 756.1 Mt CO2, which was an increase of 2.7%. In light of the fact that this amendment had simultaneously been published by the United Kingdom with a view to obtaining comments of the public, the operators concerned would have been aware of that increase seven weeks before the opening of the market. The argument of the Commission, based on the idea that the stability of the market amounted to an imperative rule, was exaggerated, especially with regard to amendments proposed before the opening of the market and thus it could not be accepted. The court held that the Commission made an error of law in rejecting the amendments proposed by the United Kingdom as inadmissible. Therefore, the single plea raised by the United Kingdom was declared to be well founded and the contested decision was annulled.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the ECJ ruled that the coal is essential to the functioning of the power plant and is therefore directly associated with the plant’s activity. Moreover, because the coal’s self-heating emits greenhouse gases, storing coal is an activity that could have an effect on emissions and pollution within the meaning of Article 3(e) of Directive 2003/87/EC. The ECJ deemed it irrelevant that the storage site is located approximately 800 meters and across a public road from the power plant.<br><br></div><div>On the second question, the ECJ ruled that coal lost due to self-heating while in storage on a site that is part of an installation cannot be regarded as coal exported from that installation.

Instead, she claimed that Ziegelwerk Höxter's contingent liabilities were solely to be registered as claims in the insolvency procedure.&nbsp;<br><br>The Court held that the EU legislature must be allowed broad discretion in applying penalties and that the relatively high level of the penalty is justified by the need to have infringements of the obligation to surrender a sufficient number of allowances treated in a stringent and consistent manner throughout the European Union.

It additionally interpreted Article 3(c) and (h) of Commission Decision 2011/278/EU concerning rules for the temporary free allocation of emission allowances pursuant to Article 10a of Directive 2003/87.&nbsp;<br><br>The court concluded that Article 3(u) of Directive 2003/87/EC must be interpreted to mean that an installation, such as that at issue in the proceedings, (which produces electricity through the ""combustion of fuels in installations with a total rated thermal input exceeding 20 [megawatts (MW)]""), must be understood as an ‘electricity generator' when even a small portion of that electricity is continuously fed into the public electricity network (unless the product of the installation meets an exempted category in the annex). The installation in question could not be exempted even if its purpose was to produce electricity for the natural gas processing facility.&nbsp;<br><br>The Court of Justice further determined that Article 3(c) of Commission Decision 2011/278/EU must be interpreted to mean that an installation such as that at issue in the main proceedings is not entitled to be allocated free emission allowances for the heat produced ""where that heat is used for purposes other than the production of electricity, since such an installation does not fulfill the conditions laid down in Article 10a(4) and (8) of the directive."" The activities of natural gas desulphurisation and sulphur recovery did not meet the criteria of those articles. An analyst reviewing the decision noted that if it is followed by EU governments, it could result in thousands of facilities no longer qualifying for free allocation of ghg emission permits and drive up the cost of carbon in the market.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,

Trinseo applied for free allocation of emission allowances to its installation for the trading period 2013?2020, which the German government denied because polycarbonates do not fall under the list of products approved for free allocation. Trinseo originally claimed that it was entitled to free allocation of emissions allowances because the steam it uses during the production of polymers requires the emission of greenhouse gases.&nbsp;<br><br>The German government rejected this application and, subsequently, Trinseo sued the German government in the Berlin Administrative Court, which referred the case to the ECJ for preliminary ruling. The ECJ considered ""whether Article 2(1) of Directive 2003/87 must be interpreted as meaning that an installation for the production of polymers, in particular the polymer polycarbonate, such as the installation at issue in the main proceedings, which obtains the heat needed for that production from a third-party installation, falls within the activity of ‘[p]roduction of bulk organic chemicals by cracking, reforming, partial or full oxidation or by similar processes', within the meaning of Annex I to that directive, so that it must be considered to fall within the scope of the emissions allowance trading scheme established by that directive.""&nbsp;<br><br>The ECJ ruled that, because Directive 2003/87/EC is intended to incentivise emissions reductions in companies, and because polycarbonate production does not directly produce emissions, Trinseo was not entitled to free allocation of emissions trading allowances. Rather, only the company that directly emits greenhouse gases as the result of producing steam, which might later be used to manufacture polymers, is entitled to free emissions allocations.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,

When adopting this measure, the Council did not adopt it under a special legislative procedure pursuant to Article 192(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).

An increase in emission allowance prices could lead to a change in the competitiveness of various types of power stations and in the structure of electricity production at a national level, and to a decrease in the competitiveness of the energy sector and the Polish economy.

Plaintiffs allege that the EU’s existing target to reduce domestic ghg emissions by 40% by 2030, as compared to 1990 levels, is insufficient to avoid dangerous climate change and threatens plaintiffs’ fundamental rights of life, health, occupation, and property.<br><br></div><div>The lawsuit has two major components. First, plaintiffs bring a nullification action, asking the court to declare three EU legal acts as void for failing to set adequate ghg emissions targets. The three EU legal acts are: Directive 2003/87/EC governing emissions from large power generation installations (ETS); regulation 2018/EU on emissions from industry, transport, buildings, agriculture, and etc. (ESR); and regulation 2018/EU on emissions from and removals by land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF). Plaintiffs argue that inadequate emissions reductions violate higher order laws that protect fundamental rights to health, education, occupation, and equal treatment as well as provide obligations to protect the environment. These higher rank laws include: the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (ChFR), the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Paris Agreement. Plaintiffs ask the court to order that the three emissions reductions laws remain in force until improved versions of the Acts can be enacted. Art. 263 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) is the basis for this procedural action.<br><br></div><div>The second action concerns non-contractual liability. Article 340 of the TFEU provides a mechanism for injunctive relief when three conditions are met: 1) there is an unlawful act by the EU institution(s), 2) the unlawful act is a serious breach of a law that protects individual rights, and 3) there is a sufficient causal link between the breach and the damages.<br><br></div><div>Demanded relief is an injunction to compel the EU to set more stringent ghg emissions reductions targets through the existing framework of the ETS, ESR and LULUCF regimes in order to bring the EU into compliance with its legal obligations. Plaintiffs assert this would require a 50%-60% reduction in ghg emissions below 1990 levels by 2030 or whatever level the court finds appropriate.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The European General Court did not rule on the merits, but dismissed the case on procedural grounds, finding that the plaintiffs could not bring the case since they are not sufficiently and directly affected by these policies (“direct and individual concern” criterion). The court concluded that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the case because climate change affects every individual in one manner or another and case law requires that plaintiffs are affected by the contested act in a manner that is “peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons, and by virtue of these factors distinguishes them individually.” The court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the interpretation of the concept of ‘individual concern’ referred to in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU is not compatible with a fundamental right to effective judicial protection under Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Nor did the court find that plaintiffs could bring the case under the other possible criteria under the fourth paragraph of Article 263 of the TFEU which would require that they were direct addressees of the legislative package in question or they contested a regulatory act that was of direct concern to them.<br><br></div><div>The plaintiffs appealed to the European Court of Justice on July 11, 2019, arguing that the EU General Court erred in concluding that plaintiffs lacked standing under Article 263, and by holding that plaintiffs needed to establish standing under Article 263 in order to bring a claim for non-contractual liability.<br><br>On March 25, 2021, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) upheld the General Court's order and held the plaintiff's claims inadmissible on standing grounds for failing to demonstrate that they were individually impacted by Europe's climate policy. The ECJ rejected plaintiffs' arguments that the General Court did not take into account the climate harms specific to them. Rather, the ECJ found sufficient the lower court's reasoning that ""the fact that the effects of climate change may be different for one person than they are for another does not mean that, for that reason, there exists standing to bring an action against a measure of general application,"" and that doing so would render standing limitations meaningless. Further, the ECJ rejected the argument that, by invoking an infringement of fundamental rights, the plaintiffs had established standing. ""[T]he appellants’ reasoning, in addition to its generic wording, leads to the conclusion that there is locus standi for any applicant, since a fundamental right is always likely to be concerned in one way or another by measures of general application such as those contested in the present case."" The ECJ thus dismissed the appeal and ordered plaintiffs to pay costs incurred by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.</div>",,,,,,,,,,

Here the EIB's decision was based on an assessment of whether it met renewable energy goals and therefore impacted environmental law.

Plaintiffs stress that particular vulnerability of Grande-Synthe to the impacts of climate change as a low-lying coastal municipality exposed to sea level rise and flooding. According to the plaintiffs' case summary, Grande-Synthe asks the Conseil d'Etat to direct the government to take legislative and regulatory measures to prioritize action on climate change and to prohibit actions that would increase greenhouse gas emissions. This case is one of two filed in France during early 2019 against the French government for climate inaction and that follows logic set by the 2018 Urgenda decision in the Netherlands.

The prosecutor sought to impose a fine of 500 euros on each defendant. The court heard testimony from a former government minister that France has not complied with the Paris Agreement due to a lack of political will, and that only the president can order the action required by the present situation. An ecologist also testified about the necessity for rapid change in order to limit temperature rise. The defendants argued that the use of legal channels and warnings from scientific experts had not provided sufficient leverage, and they believed that acts of nonviolent civil disobedience were required to raise awareness of the need for policy change.<br><br></div><div>The court agreed, finding that climate change seriously affects the future of humanity by provoking natural disasters, leading to violent conflicts, and threatening flora and fauna; and that although France is committed to certain measures to address climate change, the defense's submissions showed that the government's objectives will not be achieved.

The wind farm was expected to damage part of the forest cover and several protected species. The developer sought an exemption from the prohibition against harming natural habitats and protected animal and plant species under the French Environmental Code. Such an exemption may be granted “in the interest of public health and safety or for other imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including of a social or economic nature."" However, case law consistently holds that, even where such a public interest exists, a waiver can only be granted if there is no satisfactory alternative solution and it does not prejudice the maintenance of the affected species.<br><br></div><div>The prefect of Morbihan granted the waiver. Two local associations -- Society for the Protection of Landscapes and Aesthetics of France and Society for the Study and Protection of Nature in Brittany -- along with several local residents brought an action for annulment of this decree. The lower court granted their requests and annulled the order; the ACA then overturned the judgment after the developer appealed.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The ACA reasoned that the wind farm increases the production of renewable energy, making it easier to meet the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change provided by legislation, by regional planning instruments, by European-level position papers, and by international agreements. The ACA also noted the region’s high energy dependency. Thus, taking into account this local context and the need to meet the objectives of developing renewable energy, the court ruled that the project must be considered as meeting an imperative reason of major public interest likely to justify the harm to protected species. The court also analyzed the measures to avoid, reduce, compensate for and monitor the project's impacts on the protected areas, and concluded that their implementation would allow the maintenance of the species concerned in a favorable conservation status.<br><br></div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This type of letter is part of a legal proceeding known as “recours en carence fautive” (action for failure to act). The plaintiffs allege that the French government’s failure to implement proper measures to effectively address climate change violated a statutory duty to act. The four plaintiff groups are Fondation pour la Nature et l’Homme (FNH), Greenpeace France, Notre Affaire à Tous and Oxfam France. In their press release, they describe the lawsuit as challenging the state's inaction on climate change and failure to meet its own goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing renewable energy, and limiting energy consumption.<br><br></div><div>On February 15, 2019, the French government rejected the plaintiffs' request. On March 14, 2019, the plaintiffs initiated the lawsuit by filing a ""summary request"" before the Administrative Court of Paris. The plaintiffs request that the State of France be enjoined to remedy its inadequate action on climate change. Specifically, they request the court to order France to:&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>1. Take proper measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere - in due proportion considering global emissions, and taking into account the particular responsibility accepted by developed countries - at a level compatible with the objective to contain the rise of the average temperature of the planet below the threshold of 1.5 °C compared to pre-industrial levels;<br>2. Take, at least, all necessary measures to achieve France's targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, developing renewable energies and increasing energy efficiency;<br>3. Take the necessary measures to adapt the national territory to the effects of climate change;<br>4. Take the necessary measures to protect citizens’ lives and health from the risks of climate change.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>They further request compensation for the damages suffered as a result of the State’s failure to tackle climate change to be paid as “the symbolic sum of 1 euro for their moral prejudice.”&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>According to a translation of the legal request, plaintiffs argue that the government has both general and specific legal duties to act on climate change. Its general duties stem from 1) the French Charter for the Environment (“the Charter”), the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECPHR), and 3) the general principle of law providing the right of every person to live in a preserved climate system. Under the Charter, plaintiffs point to citizens’ constitutional rights to live in a healthy and ecologically balanced environment and argue the government has a duty of care to “take all necessary measures to identify, avoid, reduce and compensate the consequences of climate change.” Like other recent international cases, they point to further obligations of the state to act on climate change to uphold the rights guaranteed under Articles 2 &amp; 8 of the ECPHR, respectively “the right to life” and the “right to respect for private and family life.” They argue that these rights require States “to implement a legislative and regulatory framework and to adopt practical measures meant to fight efficiently against climate change.”&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Plaintiffs further base their claims on a “general principle of law” providing a right to a “preserved climate system” which they argue stems from national law (such as the preamble of the Charter for the Environment, article L. 110-1 of the French Environment Code, etc.) and international law (the Stockholm Declaration, the World Charter for Nature, the Rio Declaration, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto protocol, the Paris Agreement, the Climate action and renewable energy package for 2020, the Decision n°406/2009/CE of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 23 April 2009). Plaintiffs additionally argue the State has further “specific” obligations to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions under EU and national law as well as specific obligations to take action to prepare for the impacts of climate change on France.<br><br>On June 26th, 2020, the ministry for the ecological transition asked the administrative court's judge to dismiss the request. According to the plaintiffs, the government asserted that it was taking action to address greenhouse gas emissions, and that the time has not elapsed for it to meet its 2020 goals.<br><br>The case was heard in court on January 14, 2020. At the hearing the public rapporteur (independant consultant judge who provides an opinion to help guide the court's decision) issued an opinion. According to the plaintiffs, the opinion urged the court to recognize the fault of the French government, to recognize climate change as pure ecological damage, to award damages of one euro for moral prejudice, but to stop short of issuing an injunction because past damage cannot be repaired.<br><br></div><div>On February 3, 2021, the Administrative Court of Paris issued a decision recognizing that France's inaction has caused ecological damage from climate change and awarded the plaintiffs the requested one euro for moral prejudice caused by this inaction. The Court deferred the decision the on whether to issue an injunction to order the French government to take stronger climate measures, and ordered the government to disclose steps it was taking to meet its climate targets within two months. As part of the decision, the Court held that France could be held responsible for failing to meet its own climate and carbon budget goals under EU and national law. But the Court rejected arguments that the government could be forced to meet more specific renewable energy and energy efficiency targets on the grounds that such sectoral measures cannot be independently directly linked to ecological damage. Further, the Court declined to issue compensatory damages for ecological harm, as the Court found that the plaintiffs had not shown that the government will be unable to repair the harm caused.</div>",,,,,,,

Luciano Lliuya’s suit alleged that RWE, having knowingly contributed to climate change by emitting substantial volumes of greenhouse gases (GHGs), bore some measure of responsibility for the melting of mountain glaciers near his town of Huaraz, population 120,000. That melting has given rise to an acute threat: Palcacocha, a glacial lake located above Huaraz, has experienced a substantial volumetric increase since 1975, which has accelerated since 2003. Luciano Lliuya presented several legal theories in support of his claim, including one that characterized RWE's emissions as a nuisance that Luciano Lliuya had incurred compensable costs to mitigate. Acknowledging that RWE was only a contributor to the emissions responsible for climate change and thus for the lake's growth, Luciano Lliuya asked the court to order RWE to reimburse him for a portion of the costs that he and the Huaraz authorities are expected to incur to establish flood protections. That portion was 0.47% of the total cost -- the same percentage as RWE’s estimated contribution to global industrial greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of industrialisation.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The court dismissed Luciano Lliuya’s requests for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as his request for damages. The court noted that it could not provide Luciano Lliuya with effective redress (Luciano Lliuya's situation would not change, the court said, even if RWE ceased emitting), and that no “linear causal chain” could be discerned amid the complex components of the causal relationship between particular greenhouse gas emissions and particular climate change impacts.<br><br></div><div>On November 30, 2017, the appeals court recognized the complaint as well-pled and admissible. The case will move forward into the evidentiary phase to determine whether the Luciano Lliuya’s home is (a) threatened by flooding or mudslide as a result of the recent increase in the volume of the glacial lake located nearby, and (b) how RWE’s greenhouse gas emissions contribute to that risk. The court will review expert opinion on the RWE’s CO2 emissions, the contribution of those emissions to climate change, the resulting impact on the Palcaraju Glacier, and RWE’s contributory share of responsibility for causing the preceding effects. While the facts of this case must still be adjudicated, the court’s recognition that a private company could potentially be held liable for the climate change related damages of its greenhouse gas emissions marks a significant development in law.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the court dismissed an action by German families to challenge the government’s failure to adhere to a cabinet decision to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2020, concluding that the target was not legally enforceable.<br><br></div><div>In December 2014, the German cabinet set a goal of reducing national greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels by the end of 2020 (the Climate Protection Plan). According to the government’s 2018 official climate protection report, however, the government will likely only achieve a reduction of 32% from 1990 levels by the end of 2020. In October 2018, three German families and Greenpeace Germany filed suit in the Administrative Court of Berlin seeking to compel the German government to adhere to the 40% reduction goal. The German families are comprised of organic farmers who claim they are already experiencing the impacts of climate change. Plaintiffs argued that the government was bound by the Climate Protection Plan, and alleged that the government’s failure to adhere to the 40% target encroaches on their human rights in violation of the German Constitution -- the Grundgesetz -- under Article 2(2) (right to life and health), Article 12(1) (occupational freedom), and Article 14(1) (right to property). They further alleged that failure to meet the original 2020 goal violates Germany’s minimum obligations under the EU Effort Sharing Decision (406/2009/EC).&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>According to Greenpeace, plaintiffs asked for court orders holding that the government is obliged to: 1) implement the national Climate Protection Program 2020 by updating or supplementing appropriate measures to meet the 2020 target; 2) compensate for the excess of approximately 650 million tons of CO2 equivalent between 2007 and today due to insufficient implementation of the 2020 target; and 3) supplement the national Climate Protection Program 2020 to meet the reduction targets set out in European environmental law. Greenpeace reports that this is the first climate lawsuit to refer to the publication of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Special Report on 1.5°C.<br><br></div><div>On October 31, 2019 the Administrative Court of Berlin dismissed the case, concluding that the 2020 target, as a cabinet decision, was not legally binding. The court further held that plaintiffs had not conclusively demonstrated that the government had violated its constitutional obligations by setting inadequate climate protection targets. However, the court did hold that the government’s climate policy is subject to judicial review and must be consistent with the government’s duties to protect fundamental rights under the German Constitution. The court also determined that the government must undertake measures to provide adequate and effective protection of the fundamental rights potentially affected by climate change, including the rights to life and property. Nonetheless, the court concluded that the government is entitled to wide discretion in deciding how to fulfill these obligations, so long as precautionary measures to protect fundamental rights not are wholly unsuitable or wholly inadequate. In the court’s view, the government’s current protection policy, which will lower emissions by 32% rather than 40% by the end of 2020, is within its discretion.<br><br></div><div>Moreover, the court noted that the EU is only aiming for a 40% reduction in greenhouse emissions by 2030 and has pledged a reduction of only 20% below 1990 levels by 2020.

Their claims principally arose out of the principle of human dignity allegedly enshrined in Article 1 of the Basic Law; Article 2 of the Basic Law, which protects the right to life and physical integrity; and Article 20a of the Basic Law, which protects the natural foundations of life in responsibility for future generations.

Further, the Court stated that Article 20a ""is a justiciable legal norm that is intended to bind the political process in favour of ecological concerns, also with a view to the future generations that are particularly affected."" Accepting arguments that the legislature must follow a carbon budget approach to limit warming to well below 2°C and, if possible, to 1.5°C, the Court found that that legislature had not proportionally distributed the budget between current and future generations. The Court held that “the regulations at stake would be unconstitutional if they allowed so much of the remaining budget to be consumed that the future loss of freedom would inevitably assume unacceptable proportions from today's perspective, because there would be no time left for mitigating developments and transformations.” The Court ordered the legislature to set clear provisions for reduction targets from 2031 onward by the end of 2022.<br><br></div>",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jan Chetna v. Ministry of Environment & Forests,India,IND,India,Appeal No. 22 of 2011(T),Adaptation,Challenge to application of grant given for development.,,,Social development,Jan Chetna|individual,Ministry of Environment & Forests|government,,01/01/2011|Case opened,"M/s. Scania Steels & Power Ltd. (formerly known as Sidhi Vinayak Sponge Iron Ltd.) was operating a Sponge Iron Plant in Village Punjipatra, Tehsil Gharghoda, District Raigarh in the State of Chhattisgarh, before 2004 i.e. prior to issuance of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006. The production capacity of the said existing unit was 66,000 TPA of Sponge Iron (2 x 100 TPD kilns). In the year, 2008, M/s Scania Steels & Power Ltd. (hereinafter called as Scania for the sake of brevity) applied to the Ministry of Environment and Forest (in short MoEF) for expansion of the existing project. It proposed to enhance the production of Sponge Iron from 66,000 TPA to 1,32,000 TPA by adding another unit or 66,000 TPA, install a Steel Melting Shop (Induction Furnace, 3x15 tons) with CCM facility of 1,35,000 TPA capacity, a Ferro Alloy Plant (5MVA) of 7,5000 TPA and Captive Power Plant of 25 MW, (AFBC 17 MW + WHRB 8 MW). The proposal was considered by the MoEF and environment clearance (in short EC) was granted by letter dated 5th November, 2008 for the proposed expansion.


Jan Chetna (Appellant No.1) claiming to be a social and environmental group formed with the objective of working for the welfare of the local communities and creating awareness on social and environmental issues, represented through one or its Member Shri Ramesh Agrawal, and Shri Rajesh Tripathi claiming to be a Project affected person, having agriculture land adjacent to the project site and also claiming to be a social activist and a member of Jan Chetna, assailed the order dated 5th November, 2008, passed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) granting EC for expansion of the project in question before the then National Environment Appellate Authority (NEAA). The NEAA dismissed the Appeal. The said order was assailed by the present Appellant before the High Court of Delhi in WPC No.11157 of 2009, which set aside the order passed by NEAA and directed the said Authority to dispose of the Appeal on merits, as expeditiously as possible. While NEAA was in session of the case, The NGT Act was promulgated and in consonance with the provisions of the said Act, the Appeal stood transferred to this Tribunal.
The learned judges heard the counsel for the parties at length; perused the pleadings, documents annexed by the parties and notes of submissions, meticulously; and considered the submissions of all the Learned Counsel diligently. The controversies involved in this Appeal are as follows:-


i) Whether the Appellants have locus-standi to prefer the Appeal and assail the EC granted in favour of M/s. Scania Steels & Power Ltd. (Respondent No. 3)?
ii) Whether the proposal submitted to enhance the production of existing Sponge Iron Unit from 66,000 TPA to further 66,000 TPA by installing a new unit, setting up a Steel Melting Shop with CCM facility of 1,35,000 TPA capacity, a Ferro Alloy Plant of 7,500 TPA and Captive Power Plant of 25 MW, would amount to expansion of the existing Sponge Iron Plant of 66,000 TPA established prior to 2004 or amounts to installing new projects?
iii) As to whether the proposal satisfies the requirement of Clause-7(ii) of EIA Notification, 2006 and Public Hearing / consultation can be exempted?
iv) Whether the Authorities have duly applied their mind to the facts and circumstances, the scientific data and other particulars submitted by the Project Proponent, and the decision taken to grant EC was justified or proper?


Before entering into the area of controversy, the learned judges recapitulate the principles relating to Industrial Development vis-à-vis sustainable development. It is now well settled by a series of judgments of the Supreme Court that though the industrial development is of vital importance to the country as it generates foreign exchange and provides employment avenues, it has no right to destroy the ecology, degrade the environment and pose health hazards. In view of the constitutional and statutory provisions (as mentioned in the original judgement), the Court held that ""Precautionary Principle"" and the ""Polluter Pays Principle"" are part of the environment law of the country.


The expression ""aggrieved persons"" cannot be considered in a restricted manner. The Tribunal has no hesitation to hold that that the Appellants satisfy the definition of ""Person aggrieved"" and they have locus-standi to file this Appeal.


A cumulative reading of the provisions of EIA Notifications, 2006 in the touch stone of the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme court in different decisions, gives an impression that public consultations as incorporated in 2006 Notification is in recognition and in furtherance of the rights to the environment. Public consultations ordinarily have two components; (i) public hearing at the site or in its close proximity and (ii) to obtain responses in writing from other concerned persons having a plausible stake in the environmental aspects of the project or activity.


The wording of Clause 7(ii) is very clear and is bereft of any ambiguity. It stipulates that all applications seeking prior environmental clearance for expansion, with increase in the production capacity beyond the capacity for which Prior Environmental Clearance has been granted under this Notification, or with increase either in lease area or production capacity etc. etc., would attract the exclusion of Public consultation. In the case in hand, the production capacity of an existing Sponge Iron Unit is sought to be enhanced, and its production capacity increased, but then no environmental clearance has been granted to the said existing Sponge Iron Unit, under EIA Notification, 2006, thus the concession not to hold public consultation cannot be extended to the expansion of the existing Sponge Iron Unit. Furthermore, all the proposed units being interlinked and dependent on one another, and as no unit can be established in the absence of the other, the learned judges are of the view that the decision taken to exempt Public Consultation to the entire project under Clause 7(ii) of the EIA Notification, 2006, was not just and proper specially due to significant increase in pollution load and consequential environmental ramifications. Considering the magnitude of the proposed project, they further feel that the public in general should have given an opportunity of putting forth their views with regard to the projects.


In view of the infirmities noticed during the course of hearing, the MoEF is directed to develop appropriate mechanism, to check the authenticity of environmental data reported in the EIA/EMP report which would facilitate a more realistic environmental appraisal of project. Steps should also be taken for black listing Consultants found to have reported ""cooked data"" or ""wrong data"" and for producing sub-standard EIA/EMP report.


Strict reading of Clause 7(ii) of EIA Notification, 2006 clearly provides power to EAC or State Level EAC to decide on due diligence necessary including preparation of EIA and Public Consultations only for those expansion proposals or modernization of existing units, which were accorded prior environmental clearance, under this Notification (EIA Notification, 2006). In the present case, as has been held, neither exemption from Public Consultation is applicable under expansion category nor under modernization pretext as the expansion proposal of M/s Scania Steel and Power Ltd., which is an existing Sponge Iron Plant, was not accorded prior environmental clearance under the EIA Notification, 2006. It also does not satisfy the category of modernization of the existing unit, as a number of new facilities such as Induction Furnace, Ferro Allow Plant and Captive Power Plant have been proposed to be added which would certainly result in additional pollution load in the area. The legislators, while framing Clause 7(ii) of EIA Notification, 2006, might have kept in mind that if Public Consultation has already been done earlier under EIA Notification, 2006 while giving prior EC, the same Public Hearing (in short PH) need not be required again at the time of expansion or modernization of unit.


Only because, the authorities have exempted Public Consultation in respect of some other projects, cannot be ground for exempting the same so far as Scania is concerned. Law is well settled that each case has to be determined and decided in consonance with the facts and circumstances relating to the said case and there cannot be a universal decision to either conduct or exempt public hearing while granting EC.
In view of the discussions made in the preceding paragraphs, the MoEF is directed to get public consultation (Public Hearing) conducted for the proposed projects at the site or nearby area of the site as per the provisions contained in the EIA Notification, 2006. This direction is necessary in order to achieve the object and purpose of the Notification 31 vis-a-vis the Statute. Till the aforesaid exercise is completed, the EC granted on 5th November, 2008 for the proposed expansion of Integrated Steel Plant and Captive Power Plant at Village Kunjipatra, District Raigarh, Chhattisgarh by M/s. Scania Steel and Power Limited, shall remain suspended. It is needless to say that the MoEF shall take prompt steps for completing the exercise of public consultation (Public Hearing) and curing the deficiency in EIA/EMP, and re-visit the entire project in the light of the observations made by this Tribunal and complete the entire exercise as expeditiously as possible. It is needless to be said that the EC granted would be subject to the decision to be taken by the MoEF after public consultation, and other directions.

The appellants (applicants in Application No. 74 of 2014 hereafter commonly referred as ‘appellants) are persons interested in the protection of environment and ecology. They are persons aggrieved and affected due to the Vizhinjam Port Project (for short ‘the project'). The Appellants are fishermen belonging to families that traditionally do fishing in the project area and are representatives of the larger community of fisher folk who inhabit that area. By the project, not only the ecology and environment of that area would be affected but there would also be adverse impact on their livelihood. The Appellants are also the registered members of the Fish Workers Welfare Board formed by the Government of Kerala to give assistance to the people in the fishing occupation. This is the benchmark to determine that Appellants are sea-going fishermen. Vizhinjam International Seaport Limited (Respondent No. 3, Hereafter ‘the Project Proponent ') formulated a project for development of Vizhinjam International Deep water Multipurpose Sea Port at Vizhinjam in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) district, in the State of Kerala. This Project involves the construction of quays, terminal area and port building and is expected to be completed in three phases. The first phase is proposed to be built on 66 hectares of land to be reclaimed from the sea. The material required for phase I reclamation is proposed to be obtained from dredging activity in the sea. This phase requires 7 million metric tonnes of stone, aggregates, sand and soil for construction of a breakwater stretching almost 3.180 Kms into the sea. This material is sought to be sourced from blasting quarries in Trivandrum and in neighbouring district of Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu State, possibly falling in Western Ghats region.

By order dated October 1st, 2003, Division Bench of the High Court, transferred the Writ Petition to this Tribunal in view of Judgment of the Apex Court in the case of ""Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan &amp; Anr Vs Union of India"" (2012) 8, SCC 326. The case of the Applicants, as can be gathered from the pleadings of the Writ Petition, is that there are ten projects as stated in the petition, which are Irrigation Projects of large scale, minor scale, Percolation Tank etc. For the purpose of these irrigation projects, the Respondents have planned to divert forest area, without taking due Forest Clearance (FC) from the competent Authority. They are likely to cut down large number of trees in the range of 2.5 to 3 lakhs, which will cause severe environmental damage. The Applicants further allege that some part of Yawal sanctuary is likely to be submerged in irrigation project called ""Handya-Kundya""Project, which will affect the wildlife in the said sanctuary. So also, it will affect Teak wood and Bamboo trees within the area of said sanctuary. The Respondent Nos.2 to 6 (2.The State of Maharashtra, 3. The Chief Conservator of Forests, Seminary hills, Nagpur, 4. The Conservator of Forests, Dist. Dhule, 5. The Deputy Conservator of Forests, Jalgaon Division 6, The Deputy Conservator of Forests, Yawal Division), resisted the petition on various grounds. According to them, total land covered by the said ten projects is 6,394.18 Ha. All the projects are for public welfare and the cost benefit ratio is more than the loss of number of trees, which is estimated during the study that was undertaken before planning of the projects. They submit that by way of compensation equal area of non- forest land was received and shall be utilized for afforestation. They further submit that they will plant large number of trees over the available land of 1423.8 Ha. The felling of trees is 133179, whereas 2562966 seedlings are sought to be planted. The project will solve the water scarcity problem faced by the local public members. It will also cause benefit to the Agriculturists, because irrigation facility will be available to them for irrigation of their lands. It is denied that wildlife is likely to be disturbed due to the projects or any part thereof.

Vimal Bhai v. Ministry of Environment & Forests,India,IND,India,Appeal No. 5 of 2011,Mitigation,Challenge to the construction of a dam.,,,Energy,Vimal Bhai|individual,Ministry of Environment & Forests|government,,14/12/2011|Appeal denied|The Tribunal concluded that there were no substantial merits calling for interference into the forest clearing in question and disposed of the appeal.,"This appeal is filed being aggrieved by the grant of Forest Clearance (for short FC) accorded by the First respondent through its Order No. 8-65/2009 – FC dated 3rd of June 2011 under which deforestation of 80.507 hectares of government forest land diverted for construction of 65m high diversion dam across river Alakhnanda near village Helong in Chamoli District of Uttarakhand State for the purpose of generating hydroelectricity power.


The Environmental Clearance (for short EC) was already granted as early as 22nd August 2007 by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (for short MoEF). It has been more than three years, and the EC has not been challenged so it is valid. Thus, the only challenge made is for the grant of FC and not EC.
Appellant No. 1 is a Gandhian Social Activist working for the Environment Protection and Peoples' right over the natural resources in middle Himalaya area since 1988. Appellant No. 2 is an economist and a former Professor of Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore and lives on the bank of the river Alaknanda. Appellant No. 3 is a Social Activist and elected as Van Sarpanch of Village Naurakh. All of them are affected by the FC of the Vishnugad-Pipalkoti hydro power project in which construction of a 65m high diversion dam across river Alaknanda at Helong Village, Chamoli district of Uttarakhand State is proposed.


The total land requirement of the project is about 120 hectares. Out of which, about 40ha is agriculture land and about 80 hectares is government forest land. The grant of FC in the present case was substantially based on the study made by Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (for short IITR) and Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun (for short WII). As per the scope of work, ""effectiveness of mitigative measures and compliance of stipulated conditions on which various projects earlier have been examined"", was to be completed, however, no such study was conducted. Thus, the recommendation of the Forest Advisory Committee (for short FAC) was based on non-existent study and as such is arbitrary and whimsical. The Respondents No. 1 to 3 have filed their detailed relies. According to them, all the allegations made and the grounds raised in the appeal are all baseless and liable to be rejected.


The following questions arise for considerations in this appeal-
a) Whether the appellants can be called as aggrieved and /or injured ""person(s)"" as defined under the National Green Tribunal (for short NGT) Act and the appeal is maintainable by them:
A reading of Sections 2(j), (i) to (viii) of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 would reveal that any individual, Hindu undivided family, Company, Firm, an association of persons or a body of individuals whether incorporated or not, trustees of a trust, a local authority and every artificial juridical person not falling within any of the preceding sub-clauses, would indicate ""person"" who can maintain an application/appeal under the NGT Act. But, it is the argument of the learned counsel of the Respondent that even the above defined person shall be a person either aggrieved or injured directly or indirectly and not otherwise. The only exception to be made for treating an appeal/application as not maintainable could be a matter which falls beyond the seven (7) Acts as notified in Schedule I of the NGT Act 2010 and in a case of mala-fide and vexatious litigation brought before this Tribunal and not otherwise.


The statutory provisions are subservient to the constitutional mandates. The person as defined or person aggrieved as occurs in Sections 2(j), 16 and 18 (2) of the NGT Act cannot be placed above ""every citizen"" as appears in Article 51A of the Constitution of India. Once the mandate is of every citizen, any person can approach this Tribunal complaining environmental threat in the activities of the State or any organization or individual.


Therefore, the appellants are interested persons in the environment and ecology of the area, though they are not directly affected/ injured at this point of time. But, they can be definitely called aggrieved persons since they apprehend some danger, if the project is launched without taking proper precautions.
b) Whether the appellants are justified in raising grounds that may be available for challenging the EC or its conditions in the guise of challenging the grant of present FC:


Admittedly, the EC was granted to the project on 22nd August, 2007 and no challenge was made to EC. The FC alone is under challenge in this Appeal. Therefore, the submission made by learned counsel for the appellant that all the issues that arise from the EC can also be raised in this appeal cannot be countenanced and accepted. But an exception can be made when the issues overlap i.e. the issues that were considered at the time of grant of EC and again while granting FC, since they are considered one after the other, independently.


c) Whether the FC granted in favour of project proponent is in consonance with the principles of sustainable development and precautionary measures:


The appellants have raised grounds pertaining to negative impact of tunneling on water springs and its subsequent impact on forests and agriculture; Methane emissions from reservoirs; deterioration in water quality due to less absorption of beneficent chemicals; loss of aesthetic and ‘non-use values'; value of free-flowing rivers; breeding of mosquitoes in reservoirs and the negative impact on health; deprivation of sand and fish to local people; negative cultural impacts; and negative impact of blasting/ tunneling, etc. Whereas the respondents have filed detailed replies countering the allegations and relied on various documents/ reports starting from Environment Impact Assessment/Environment Management Plan report, Geological reports, Appraisal documents for World Bank loan, etc.


The process of analyzing cumulative effects is an enhancement of the traditional EIA components: (i) scoping, (ii) describing the affected environment, and (iii) determining the environmental consequences. The Cumulative Impact Assessment f(or short CIA) studies in the instant case were awarded to IITR & WII separately with elaborate TOR and time bound deliverables as evidenced from the material placed on record.


With regards to question pertaining to environmental flow, though originally part of EC, it is argued that the MoEF has stipulated at Para (xi) of the FC that minimum environmental flow as recommended in IITR study report shall be released whereas, the environmental flow determined by IITR is erroneous owing to limited data, non-use of Building Block Method and mechanical application of other methodologies as examined by Mr. Himanshu Thakkar and Parineeta Dandekar of South Asian Networks on Dams, Rivers and People. In this context, a study of International Water Management Institute (for short IWMI) has been quoted that gives environmental flow recommendations for the Ganges basin. The learned judges are of the considered opinion that the stipulations regarding environmental flow certainly follow the sustainable development and precautionary principles.


""We are of the opinion that there are no substantial merits calling for our interference into the FC, in question, granted by the Respondent No. 1. ""


The appeal stands disposed of subject to the following directions:
1. Integrated CIA Report preparation: The first respondent shall setup an appropriate committee of experts drawn from IITR and WII in the preparation of CIA report of the five projects considered in WII report to integrate the physical, biological and social impacts in making comprehensive cumulative impact assessment report and frame appropriate conclusions and recommendations within a reasonable timeframe for consideration and final review by the Ministry of Environment and Forest to avoid any unforeseen environmental and ecological threat in the study area. If this direction is not carried out, the appellant is at liberty to take appropriate steps as required under the law.


2. Preparation of Cost Benefit Analysis Norms: Considering the need for better procedures in making sound evaluation of the forest land diversion proposals, following options for cost benefit analysis shall be explored for future proposals:


a. the guidelines for cost benefit analysis may be updated/modified to provide clear instructions regarding the various cost and benefit elements to be incorporated for the purpose of arriving at cost benefit ratio; and
b. the cost benefit analysis for each proposal received for diversion of forest land shall be done adopting the prescribed procedure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Case was filed, it has not yet been decided.","<div>A petition filed by Earthjustice on behalf of the Arctic Athabaskan Council alleges that Canada's fragmentary and lax regulations of black carbon emissions threaten the Athabaskan people's human rights. The petition describes that the arctic is witnessing disproportionately large rates of warming, and alleges that this warming is having significant adverse impacts on the Athabaskan people. Those impacts include ecological disruptions that make hunting and fishing more difficult and dangerous, changes to regional topography of cultural significance, and the compromising of the Athabaskans' ability to make sense of their environment for purposes ranging from subsistence to maintenance of cultural traditions. The petition connects these impacts and the warming that causes them to black carbon by explaining that it is a pollutant with severe climate-forcing effects, including the substantial reduction in albedo (reflectivity) of snow and ice. According to the petition, Canada's failure to regulate black carbon emissions effectively is the beginning of a causal chain that ends in the violation of the Athabaskans' rights to enjoy the benefits of their culture, to property, to the preservation of health, and to their own means of subsistence as established by the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. That failure also, according to the petition, results in violations of Canada's duties to avoid transboundary harm and to protect the environment consistent with the precautionary principle. The petitioners, anticipating arguments that they failed to pursue remedies via administrative proceedings in Canada and its provinces, explain that such an approach was not feasible for the Athabaskans. For relief, the petitioners request: investigations via onsite visit and a hearing before the Commission; a declaration by the Commission that Canada's failure to regulate domestic black carbon emissions violates the American Declaration; and establishment and implementation of a plan to protect the Athabaskan people in coordination with the petitioners and the Athabaskans themselves.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding suggests that the right to a healthy environment may serve as a pathway for lawsuits brought in regard to climate change-related harms. The opinion further discussed the responsibility of governments for significant environmental damage that they cause within and beyond their borders. The Court's advisory opinion enables all States who recognize the jurisdiction of the Court—and the citizens of those countries—to file claims regarding environmental harms that impact their human rights. In such a case, the Court would assess whether the respondent State met three types of obligations: 1. Obligations to Prevent Environmental Damages: States must: A) issue regulations to prevent damages, B) establish contingency plans to minimize the possibility of major environmental accidents, C) mitigate significant damage that has already occurred, and D) carry out environmental impact studies under the conditions indicated by the Court. The Court requires environmental impact studies to address cumulative impacts, allow the participation of interested persons, and respect the traditions and culture of indigenous peoples. These studies must also be conducted by independent entities and occur prior to the activities that they evaluate. 2. Obligations to Cooperate: States must: A) cooperate in good faith with States and individuals potentially affected by environmental damage, B) notify potentially affected States that a planned activity under their jurisdiction could generate a risk of significant transboundary damages and of environmental emergencies, and C) negotiate in good faith with States potentially affected by significant transboundary harm. 3. Obligations to Provide Information, Justice, and Public Participation: States must: A) access to information related to possible effects on the environment, B) the opportunity for citizens to publicly participate in making decisions and policies that may affect the environment, and C) access to justice through national courts in regard to their environmental obligations. The Court clarified that persons potentially affected by transboundary damages must have access to justice without discrimination based on their nationality, residence, or the location of the environmental damage.

As part of this proceeding, Costa Rica sought compensation for the loss of environmental goods and services the country sustained due to Nicaragua's excavation of channels on its territory. Among the services for which Costa Rica sought compensation was the impaired ability of the excavated area to provide ""gas regulation and air quality services, such as carbon sequestration."" On February 2, 2018, the ICJ ruled how much Nicaragua must compensate Costa Rica for the loss of environmental services. This followed a ruling on the merits from December 16, 2015 that established that Nicaragua's activities were unlawful and violated Costa Rica's territorial sovereignty and navigational rights, as well as the Court's Order of 8 March 2011, and found that Costa Rica should be compensated for these unlawful activities.


Costa Rica argued that Nicaragua had, on two separate incidents, occupied the territory of Costa Rica in connection with the construction of a canal across Costa Rican territory from the San Juan River to Laguna los Portillos (or ""Harbor Head Lagoon"") and associated acts of dredging on the San Juan River. Nicaragua removed nearly 300 trees and cleared 6.19 hectares of vegetation in excavating the Costa Rican channels. The Costa Rican government sought compensation for the impaired ability of the excavated area to provide environmental goods and services including ""gas regulation and air quality services, such as carbon sequestration."" In ruling for Costa Rica, the ICJ reasoned that Nicaragua's activities significantly undermined the ability of the two areas to provide environmental goods and services. Because this loss of environmental services was a direct result of Nicaragua's actions, the ICJ ruled that Nicaragua must compensate Costa Rica US$120,000 for the impairment or loss of the environmental goods and services of the impacted area in the period prior to recovery. Furthermore, the ICJ did ""not consider that the impairment or loss"" of carbon sequestration services could be valued as a one- time loss.

The complaint calls on several Special Rapporteurs to intervene and investigate, and to recommend that the U.S. government and the states of Alaska and Louisiana take steps to address displacement caused by climate change.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The Alaska Institute for Justice submitted the complaint on behalf of five tribes located in Louisiana and Alaska: Point-au-Chien Indian Tribe, Grand Caillou/Dulac Band of Biloxi-Citimacha-Cochtow Tribe, the Atakapa-Ishak Chawasha Tribe of the Grand Bayou Indian Village, and the Native Village of Kivalina. The complaint is directed to the Special Rapporteurs on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons, and the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, among others. The complainants assert that they are being forcibly displaced from their ancestral lands as a result of climate change, and that the U.S. government has failed to protect them despite knowing for decades that climate change threatens coastal communities. They further contend that the U.S. government's inaction has gone beyond basic negligence where the government has failed to engage, consult, acknowledge and promote the self-determination of the tribes as they develop adaptation strategies, including resettlement. The complaint also alleges that by failing to federally recognize the named Louisiana tribes, the U.S. government is further hamstringing efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.<br><br></div><div>The complaint asks the Special Rapporteurs to recommend that the U.S. government recognize the self-determination and inherent sovereignty of all the tribes; grant federal recognition to those that have not yet received it; and take certain steps to protect the tribes' land and cultural heritage, among other things. The complaint further asks the Special Rapporteurs to recommend that the Louisiana state government allocate funding to the named Louisiana tribes to respond to the humanitarian crisis caused by climate change; require the oil and gas industry to give advanced notice of their intent to conduct operations that may pose a risk to tribal cultural heritage, land, and waters; and hold oil and gas corporations responsible for damages caused to the Louisiana coast, among other things. The complaint also seeks a recommendation that the Alaska state government allocate funding to implement the tribal-led relocation process for Kivalina, and that all three governments develop relocation institutional frameworks.<br><br></div><div>The complainants' claims arise out of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the Pinheiro Principles on Housing and Property Restitution, and the Peninsula Principles on human rights that must be enforced when people are forcibly displaced because of climate change. The complaint also cites the right to self-determination of all peoples, the Charter of the UN, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, and Article 3 of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,
UN Human Rights Committee Views Adopted on Teitiota Communication,International,INT,United Nations Human Rights Committee,CCPR/C/127/D/2728/2016,,<div>Kiribati citizen argued New Zealand's denial of refugee status violated international human rights.</div>,,,"Coastal zones, Cross Cutting Area",Ioene Teitiota|individual,New Zealand Government|government,,15/09/2015|Complaint filed,07/01/2020|Decision found admissible,"<div>A citizen of Kiribati filed a communication with the UN Human Rights Committee claiming that New Zealand had violated his right to life by denying him asylum despite his assertions that climate change made Kiribati uninhabitable. The Committee concluded that the communication was admissible, but that New Zealand's decision was not clearly arbitrary, a manifest error, or a denial of justice.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In 2013, Ioene Teitiota, a Kiribati citizen, sought asylum in New Zeleand, asserting that the effects of climate change and sea level rise forced him to migrate. When the Immigration and Protection Tribunal denied his claim, he appealed to the New Zealand High Court. The High Court found that the impacts of climate change on Kirabati did not qualify Teitiota for refugee status because he was not subjected to persecution required for the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Teitioa appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals. In dismissing the application, the Court of Appeals noted the gravity of climate change but stated that the Refugee Convention did not appropriately address the issue. Teitiota again appealed, this time before the Supreme Court of New Zealand. In 2015, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts’ conclusions, but did not rule out the possibility “that environmental degradation resulting from climate change or other natural disasters could [] create a pathway into the Refugee Convention or protected person jurisdiction.”<br><br></div><div>On September 15, 2015, Teitiota filed a communication with the UN Human Rights Committee, alleging that New Zealand had violated his right to life under the International Covenant on Social and Political Rights. He argued that sea level rise in Kiribati caused by climate change has created a scarcity of habitable space, resulting in violent land disputes, and environmental degradation including saltwater contamination of the freshwater supply. On January 7, 2020, the Committee ruled that the communication was admissible because Teitiota had sufficiently substantiated his claim that when he was removed to Kiribati he faced an imminent risk of being arbitrarily deprived of his life due to the effects of sea level rise. The Committee reasoned that the requirement of imminence attaches to the decision to remove the individual, and not to the anticipated harm in the receiving state, although the latter is relevant in assessing the real risk faced by the individual.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The Committee dismissed the communication on the merits, however, explaining that it could only reverse a States party's determination that was clearly arbitrary or amounted to a manifest error or a denial of justice. The Committee reasoned that the risk of an arbitrary deprivation of life must be personal, rather than rooted in the general conditions of the receiving state, except in the most extreme cases. The Committee recognized that environmental degradation and climate change constitute serious threats to the ability of present and future generations to enjoy the right to life, but upheld New Zealand's determination that Teitiota had not provided evidence that he faced any real chance of being harmed in a land dispute, would be unable to grow food or access potable water, or otherwise faced life-threatening conditions.<br><br></div><div>The Committee did find, however, that ""given that the risk of an entire country becoming submerged under water is such an extreme risk, the conditions of life in such a country may become incompatible with the right to life with dignity before the risk is realized."" Accepting Teitiota's claim that sea level rise is likely to render Kiribati uninhabitable, the Committee explained that given the 10-15 year timeframe, there was sufficient time for intervening acts by the government of Kiribati to protect its citizens.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Two Committee members dissented. One attacked the majority's reliance on the lack of evidence that Teitiota's family lacked potable water, explaining that ""potable"" does not equate to ""safe drinking water."" The second argued that the Committee placed an unreasonable burden of proof on Teitiota to establish a real risk of danger of arbitrary deprivation of life.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,

At issue was whether the approval granted to Edenderry had complied with the EU’s Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which was incorporated into Irish law in 2010. An Taisce argued that the approval had not because it had considered only the impacts of the plant’s operations but not those resulting from the peat extraction and transport involved in supplying the bulk of the plant’s feedstock.

Thus, “[t]here is functional interdependence as the power plant relies for the vast majority of its raw material on the designated bogs.” The court also noted that it made no difference that the bogs were independently subject to an air pollution licensing regime.

Despite finding a lack of standing, the High Court issued a comprehensive review of the merits in anticipation of a future appeal.<br><br></div><div>The High Court declared that, “A right to an environment that is consistent with the human dignity and well-being of citizens at large is an essential condition for the fulfilment of all human rights. It is an indispensable existential right that is enjoyed universally, yet which is vested personally as a right that presents and can be seen always to have presented, and to enjoy protection, under Art. 40.3.1° of the Constitution.” The Court elaborated that this right was not so “Utopian” as to prevent enforcement, but would rather become enforceable once made concrete through the definition and demarcation of specific duties and obligations. The High Court explained that recognizing this previously unenumerated constitutional right was a first step in this process to define and demarcate a right to an environment.<br><br></div><div>However, the High Court did not find that the Fingal County Council violated this newly recognized right to an environment by extending the planning permission for the runway. The Court explained, “. . . even though the court accepts that members of the [Friends of Irish Environment] enjoy the contended-for constitutional right, and that the [Friends of the Irish Environment] itself has standing as a body corporate, and has a sufficient basis to contend for recognition of that existing but unenumerated constitutional right, the [Friends of the Irish Environment] nevertheless did not have a right to participate in the extension decision under [Section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000] (there is no such right of participation) and it has failed to establish that there is, by reference to that section and on the facts presenting, any disproportionate interference with the personal constitutional right to an environment that is consistent with the human dignity and well-being of citizens at large. In truth, the court sees in [Section 42] nothing more than a proper and proportionate legislative interference with the said, ever-present and now expressly recognised personal constitutional right.”<br><br></div><div>Further, the High Court ruled that Friends of the Irish Environment did not fulfill standing requirements under section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, Article 11 of the Consolidated EIA Directive, or the “Aarhus Convention” (i.e. the UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters adopted on 25th June 1998 in the Danish city of Aarhus). The High Court found that neither the Planning and Development Act 2000 nor the Consolidated EIA contained requirements for further public participation in granting an extension of a planning permission. Claims concerning the original decision to grant a planning permission in 2007 were deemed impermissible collateral attacks.<br><br></div><div>The Court did not find that the Section 15 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 changed the substance of Section 42 of the Planning and Development Act in a way relevant to the claims of this case. Section 15 creates an obligation that ""A relevant body shall, in the performance of its functions, have regard to . . . the furtherance of the national transition objective, and the objective of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the effects of climate change in the State."" The High Court said that the Fingal Council would only need to provide reasons if it elected to entirely depart from the objectives of Section 15. The High Court did not believe this this sort of departure was present in the case at hand.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,

FIE alleged that the National Mitigation Plan (""the Plan""), which seeks to transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050, is inconsistent with the Act and Ireland's human rights commitments because it is not designed to achieve substantial short-term emissions reductions. The case was argued before the High Court on January 22, 2019. FIE asked the High Court to quash the government's decision to approve the Plan and, if appropriate, order that a new plan be written.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On September 19, 2019, the Court ruled for the government. The Court rejected FEI's claim that the Plan was invalid for failing to achieve substantial short-term emissions reductions, concluding that the Act does not require particular intermediate targets. The Court recognized that ""there is now limited room, or . . . carbon budget, for greenhouse gas emissions"" given the ""safe temperature rise target"" of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Court reasoned, however, that the government appropriately exercised policy making discretion afforded by the Act, explaining that the current Plan is only an initial step in achieving targets for transitioning to a low-carbon, climate resilient, and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050, and will be subject to review and revision. The Court concluded that FEI had standing to bring rights-based claims, but rejected the argument that the government had violated Ireland's Constitution and commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights because the Plan is ""but one, albeit extremely important, piece of the jigsaw.""&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On November 22, 2019, FEI appealed the ruling to the Court of Appeal. FEI also submitted an application to leapfrog the traditional appeal route and go directly to the Supreme Court. On February 13, 2020 the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, determining that exceptional circumstances warranted direct appeal. The Court explained that, ""[t]he applicant and the respondents accept that there exists a degree of urgency in respect of the adoption of remedial environmental measures. There is no dispute between the parties as to the science underpinning the Plan and the likely increase in greenhouse emissions over the lifetime of the Plan.""<br><br>On July 31, 2020, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court and issued a ruling quashing the Plan. The Court unanimously determined that the Plan falls short of the sort of specificity that the Act requires because a reasonable reader of the Plan would not understand how Ireland will achieve its 2050 goals. The Court explained that ""a compliant plan must be sufficiently specific as to policy over the whole period to 2050."" The Court, however, determined that FIE lacks standing to bring its claims under the Constitution or ECHR. The Court also concluded that FIE had not made a compelling enough case for identifying an unenumerated right to a healthy environment, separate from the rights expressly conferred by the Irish Constitution, ""[w]hile not ruling out the possibility that constitutional rights and obligations may well be engaged in the environmental field in an appropriate case.""</div>",,,,,,,

The plaintiff Friends of the Irish Environment had argued, among other things, that the Government failed to properly analyze the NPF's impact on climate change.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In February 2018 the Government of Ireland published the NPF which, along with the National Development Plan, maps out the general goals for Ireland for the period leading up to 2040. In the course of preparing the NPF the Government developed a strategic environmental assessment (SEA). Ten National Strategic Outcomes were identified: Compact Growth, Enhanced Regional Accessibility, Strengthened Rural Economies and Communities, High Quality International Connectivity, Sustainable Mobility, A Strong Economy, Enhanced Amenities and Heritage, Transition to Sustainable Energy, Sustainable Management of Water, Waste and other environmental resources, and Access to Quality Child Care, Education and Health Services. The Government determined that a policy option called Regional Effectiveness and Settlement Diversity would best suit the needs of the country in achieving the National Strategic Outcomes while accounting for projected population growth.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In May 2018, Friends of the Irish Environment filed this action against the Government of Ireland; the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government; and the Attorney General. The group challenged the NPF on a number of grounds, including that the Government failed to assess the NPF's effects on climate change when preparing the SEA. The complaint alleged that the government was required to not only identify the likely increases in greenhouse gas emissions that would occur under the NPF, but also analyze the climate impacts of those emissions. The court rejected this claim, reasoning that a quantitative assessment of the NPF's likely effect on climactic factors is not feasible because the NPF is a policy document that does not permit any specific development or project. The court further reasoned that the NPF does contain provisions designed to reduce the effects of climate change that the NPF causes. The court concluded that the SEA's consideration of climate change was therefore sufficient.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,

The court in the Hague ordered the Dutch state to limit GHG emissions to 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, finding the government’s existing pledge to reduce emissions by 17% insufficient to meet the state’s fair contribution toward the UN goal of keeping global temperature increases within two degrees Celsius of pre-industrial conditions. The court concluded that the state has a duty to take climate change mitigation measures due to the “severity of the consequences of climate change and the great risk of climate change occurring.” In reaching this conclusion, the court cited (without directly applying) Article 21 of the Dutch Constitution; EU emissions reduction targets; principles under the European Convention on Human Rights; the “no harm” principle of international law; the doctrine of hazardous negligence; the principle of fairness, the precautionary principle, and the sustainability principle embodied in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; and the principle of a high protection level, the precautionary principle, and the prevention principle embodied in the European climate policy.

The court recognized Urgenda’s claim under Article 2 of the ECHR, which protects a right to life, and Article 8 of the ECHR, which protects the right to private life, family life, home, and correspondence.

The underlying argument is that Shell has a duty to take action to reduce GHG emissions based on Art. 6:162 of the Dutch Civil Code (duty of care and human rights obligations by failing to take adequate action to curb contributions to climate change).","On Monday, April 5th, 2019, the environmental group Milieudefensie/Friends of the Earth Netherlands and co-plaintiffs served Shell a court summons alleging Shell's contributions to climate change violate its duty of care under Dutch law and human rights obligations. The case was filed in the Hague Court of Appeals. Co-plaintiffs include other NGOs (ActionAid NL, Both ENDS, Fossielvrij NL, Greenpeace NL,Young Friends of the Earth NL, Waddenvereniging) and more than 17000 citizens. The plaintiffs seek a ruling from the court that Shell must reduce its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels and to zero by 2050, in line with the Paris Climate Agreement.


This case builds on the landmark Urgenda decision which found that the Dutch government's inadequate action on climate change violated a duty of care to its citizens. In the suit against Shell, plaintiffs extend this argument to private companies, arguing that given the Paris Agreement's goals and the scientific evidence regarding the dangers of climate change, Shell has a duty of care to take action to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Plaintiffs base this duty of care argument on Article 6:162 of the Dutch Civil Code as further informed by Articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which guarantee rights to life (Article 2) and rights to a private life, family life, home, and correspondence (Article 8). Plaintiffs' argument outlines how Shell's long knowledge of climate change, misleading statements on climate change, and inadequate action to reduce climate change help support a finding of Shell's unlawful endangerment of Dutch citizens and actions constituting hazardous negligence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

That Act implements New Zealand’s responsibilities as a ratifying Annex I member of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It requires the Minister to set an emissions reduction target in keeping with the statements of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and to consider whether to revise that target as the IPCC issues updated findings. In March 2011, pursuant to the 2002 Act, the Minister had set a target of 50% reduction from 1990 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions levels by 2050. The Minister did not review or revise that target following the 2014 issuance of the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report. In July 2015, in advance of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Paris, the Minister submitted New Zealand’s intended nationally determined contribution (INDC)--and then subsequently a nationally determined contribution (NDC)--consistent with a “provisional target” of only 30% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030. As Thomson's Statement of Claim noted, “this equates to a reduction of 11% below New Zealand’s 1990 emission levels by 2030,” and thus “will not, if adopted by other developed countries in combination with appropriate targets set by developing countries, stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” Thus Thompson challenged both the target set pursuant to the 2002 law and the target set as part of New Zealand's NDC pursuant to the United National Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, both ratified by New Zealand.<br><br></div><div>The High Court of New Zealand issued its decision after the 2017 election had ousted the prior government, replacing it with a government whose members had campaigned on a commitment to eliminate all GHG emissions by 2050. Nonetheless, the court reviewed both the 2030 and 2050 targets set by the prior government's Minister and ruled on their legality. With respect to the 2050 target, the court determined that although the Minister had discretion under the 2002 act to review and determine New Zealand's emissions reduction target for 2050, that discretion was limited by the act's purpose and by the evidence contained in IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), both of which argued strongly for a lower national emissions target than the one set based on the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). However, because it was not clear that a review of the 2050 target in light of AR5 would certainly have led to the target's revision, and because the question was largely mooted by the recent election (""[s]uch a declaration would now be of historic interest only""), the court concluded merely that the Minister should have reviewed the target, but not that a decision to maintain the existing target after such a review would necessarily have been unlawful. With respect to the 2030 target in New Zealand's INDC and NDC, the court determined that it had authority to review the Minister's setting of that target but no grounds for invalidating it because the Minister had not made “any reviewable error for which the Court may intervene.”&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Regarding the authority of the courts to review climate change policy, the decision noted:<br><br></div><div>""It may be appropriate for domestic courts to play a role in Government decision making about climate change policy . . . The courts have not considered the entire subject matter is a “no go” area, whether because the state had entered into international obligations, or because the problem is a global one and one country’s efforts alone cannot prevent harm to that country’s people and their environment, or because the Government’s response involves the weighing of social, economic and political factors, or because of the complexity of the science. The courts have recognised the significance of the issue for the planet and its inhabitants and that those within the court’s jurisdiction are necessarily amongst all who are affected by inadequate efforts to respond to climate change. The various domestic courts have held they have a proper role to play in Government decision making on this topic, while emphasising that there are constitutional limits in how far that role may extend. The IPCC reports provide a factual basis on which decisions can be made. Remedies are fashioned to ensure appropriate action is taken while leaving the policy choices about the content of that action to the appropriate state body.""</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon learning from the Tribunal Registry that the claim would be heard after 2020, the claimants filed an urgency application requesting an earlier hearing.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>That application seeks the following forms of relief: - a declaration from the Tribunal that the government has breached its treaty obligations; - a recommendation that New Zealand revise its emissions reduction targets upward to a level that corresponds with keeping the global concentration of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions below 450ppm”the level that corresponds with the 2°C threshold that demarcates a stable climate from a potentially unstable one; - a recommendation that New Zealand adopt different mitigation policies, including the restructuring or replacement of its Emissions Trading Scheme; - a recommendation that New Zealand adopt policies that facilitate adaptation in ways specific to locations and resources relied upon by the Maori.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>It bases these requests for relief on several points of fact and law. The most basic of these is the relationship between sources of GHG emissions and climate changes, and the relationship between climate change and various adverse impacts on locations and resources relied upon by the Maori for physical and cultural purposes. The application also points out that New Zealand's Nationally Determined Contribution, submitted following the Paris Climate Conference in 2015, committed the country to reduce emissions by 11% relative to 1990 levels by 2030. It contrasts this target with the increase of GHG emissions in New Zealand of 24.1% relative to their 1990 levels by 2015 and the current expectation that they will increase to 30% increase by 2020.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Further facts noted in the application include that New Zealand's government encourages oil and gas exploration, controls an entity that mines coal, and controls another entity that is responsible for much of the recent conversion of forests to dairy farms. Having described the factual basis that links government policies adverse climate impacts, the claimants then point out that provisions of the Waitangi Treaty make the government responsible for the ""active protection"" of natural resources such as forests and fisheries on behalf of the Maori. In characterizing that violation, the claimants quote from the recent decision in Juliana v. United States regarding the public trust doctrine and characterize that reasoning as relevant to their claim.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

He claims customary interests in lands and other resources situated in or around Mahinepua in Northland, and asserts that various sites of customary, cultural, historical, nutritional and spiritual significance to him are close to the coast, on low-lying land or are in the sea. Smith brought suit against several defendants that operate facilities that emit greenhouse gas emissions, including dairy farms, a power station, and an oil refinery. Smith alleges that the defendants' contributions to climate change constitute a public nuisance, negligence, and breach of a duty cognizable at law to cease contributing to climate change.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The High Court of New Zealand Auckland Registry dismissed the first two claims, but not the third. The court concluded that Smith could not demonstrate public nuisance because the damage claimed was neither particular to him, nor the direct consequence of the defendants' actions. The court further reasoned that showing a public nuisance was difficult given that the defendants are complying with all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. The court determined that Smith's negligence claim must fail because he has not shown that the defendants owed him a duty of care, concluding that the damage claimed was not reasonably foreseeable or proximately caused by their actions.<br><br></div><div>The court declined to strike the third cause of action, which alleged that the defendants have a duty to cease contributing to climate change. The court found that there were ""significant hurdles"" for Smith in persuading the court that this new duty should be recognized, but determined that the relevant issues should be explored at a trial. The court explained that ""[i]t may, for example, be that the special damage rule in public nuisance could be modified; it may be that climate change science will lead to an increased ability to model the possible effects of emissions."" The court warned, however, that it would likely be unable to provide the injunctive relief that Smith seeks, which would require a ""bespoke emission reduction scheme.""</div>",,,,,,,,,,,

Their petition highlighted several key factual points:&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>-- the licenses would allow access to as-yet undeveloped fossil fuel deposits, and such development is inconsistent with the climate change mitigation required to avert global warming of 1.5°C and possibly even 2°C in excess of pre-industrial levels;<br>-- the area made accessible by the licenses would be the northernmost yet developed, and would abut the ice zone—thus rigs and tankers would be exposed to unprecedented risks of damage and spills, and their operation would deliver emissions of black carbon to the highly sensitive arctic; and<br>-- the Norwegian government will incur costs to develop the sites, and will only recoup those costs if the oil and gas they produce commands and adequately high market price.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>It situated these points in a legal context shaped most fundamentally by article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution, which establishes a “right to an environment that is conducive to health and to a natural environment whose productivity and diversity are maintained.” Other constitutional provisions cited in the petition as relevant to the licensing decision included those requiring government action to be consistent with: the precautionary principle; the no harm principle as it applies both domestically and to citizens of other countries; and human rights protections.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The Oslo District Court ruled in favor of the Norwegian Government on January 4, 2018. The court recognized that Article 112 of the Constitution is a rights provision, but found that the government did not violate any relevant rights because it had fulfilled the necessary duties before making the licensing decision. The court also declared that, “[e]missions of CO2 abroad from oil and gas exported from Norway are irrelevant when assessing whether the Decision entails a violation of Article 112.” In its assessment of whether the government had fulfilled its duties in regard to traditional environmental harm or other climate effects, the court noted that the Storting, (the Norwegian Parliament), had broadly agreed to open the southeast Barents Sea to licensing and had considered proposals to halt that licensing or review whether it was inappropriate in light of the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. According to the court’s decision, the involvement of the Storting could be found in itself sufficient to indicate that the duty to take measures had been fulfilled.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Greenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth appealed the decision to the Bogarting Court of Appeal. Appellants allege that “[t]he District Court erred in interpreting Article 112 in such a way that it limits the duty of the Norwegian government to guarantee the right to a healthy environment.” They argue that the court interpreted Article 112 too restrictively in reaching the determination that Norway is only responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions released within Norwegian territory.<br><br></div><div>On January 22, 2020, the Borgarting Court of Appeal affirmed the District Court's decision ruling that the oil and gas licenses are valid. According to a press release issued by the Court, it parted company with the District Court in holding that article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution applies to the environmental damages alleged, including emissions of greenhouse gases from the combustion of oil and gas after export, and that emissions resulting from the relevant decision cannot be considered in isolation. However, the Court of Appeal held that the threshold for a violation of article 112 is high, and courts should exercise restraint in reviewing decisions by the political branches. The Court held that the appellants could not show a violation of article 112 in this instance, particularly because it is uncertain whether and to what extent to the licenses will lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>On December 22, 2020, the Supreme Court announced its decision rejecting the appeal and upholding the licenses for deep-sea extraction. Eleven of the 15 judge panel upheld the lower court's ruling. The Court reasoned that although the Norwegian constitution protects citizens from environmental and climate harms, the future emissions from exported oil are too uncertain to bar the granting of these petroleum exploration licenses.

The Petition, filed directly with the country's Supreme Court, alleges violations of constitutionally protected Fundamental Rights, of the Public Trust Doctrine as it relates to Pakistan's atmosphere and climate, and of rights relating to the environmental degradation expected to result from burning coal to generate electricity. In support of these allegations, it highlights that Pakistan's government has acknowledged the reality and consequences of climate change with the National Climate Change Policy of 2012 and the Framework for Implementation of Climate Change Policy of 2013. While the Petition alleges a variety of specific acts or omissions by Pakistan's government, its chief focus is on the approval of a plan to develop coal fields located in the Thar desert region, located in the southeast corner of the country. That development is anticipated to increase Pakistani coal production from 4.5 to 60 million metric tons per year, with a commensurate increase in greenhouse gas emissions. It is also expected to displace residents in that region, and to lead to environmental degradation both directly (through water quality impacts) and indirectly (through air quality impacts from coal combustion). As the Petition notes, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is the source of investments of $1.2 billion for both coal field development and for the development of multiple coal-fired power plants in Pakistan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, GLACC sought a writ of mandamus from the court that would order government agencies to act on the provisions of two statutes pertaining to flood control: Republic Act 6716 ”the Rainwater Collector and Springs Development Law” requires each Filipino locality to have and maintain a rainwater collector to ensure fresh drinking water is available in times of flooding; Act 7160 or the Local Code of 1991, which establishes the responsibilities of local governments in relation to water management. The suit builds on the writ of kalikasan issued by the Supreme Court in 2009, which established both a Filipino right to environmental protection and a channel for seeking relief from infractions of that right. The petition alleges that noncompliance with the two statutes is rife and increasingly harmful as the Philippines ”the world's most typhoon-prone nation” experiences more frequent and severe storms and flooding.

The petitioners had sought the writs of kalikasan (protection of constitutional rights to a healthy environment) and continuing mandamus to compel the Presidentially-created Climate Change Commission to implement a variety of measures to promote biking and walking and disincentivize car travel. Petitioners based their claims in the Philippine Constitution and Executive Order 774, which designates a task group to reform the transportation sector and follow the principle ""those who have less in wheels must have more in road."" After the ruling that the petitioners had standing to sue and to bring their case directly to the Supreme Court, the Court dismissed the suit for failing to establish the requisites for the issuance of the writs. The Court found that petitioners had not established that the Commission was guilty of violation or neglect of environmental laws as required by the writ of kalikasan. Further, petitioners failed to prove direct or personal injury arising from the government's failure to act, as required by the writ of continuing mandamus.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, the project would operate until about 2060. The court, after observing that the statute does not expressly contemplate climate change, held that such considerations are relevant and that their absence from the environmental review of the project made its approval unlawful. This question came before the court as a result of EarthLife Africa Johannesburg's appeals. The first appeal was submitted to the Minister of Environmental Affairs to challenge the adequacy of the project's environmental review; EarthLife argued that the review was invalid because it largely ignored climate change. The second was submitted to the High Court in Pretoria to challenge the Minister's mealy-mouthed determination that the review was legally valid even though it would have to be supplemented by a climate change analysis because issues related to climate mitigation and adaptation had not ""comprehensively assessed and/or considered.""<br><br></div><div>The court cited several reasons, including South Africa’s commitments under the Paris Agreement, for its conclusion that climate change is indeed a relevant consideration for the environmental review of the Thabametsi Project.

The sale was prompted in part by an environmental review that recommended Swedish divestment from fossil assets. Environmental NGOs and individual plaintiffs challenged the sale as a violation of the Swedish government's duty of care to its citizens to protect their right to a non-harmful climate. The plaintiffs' petition grounds this duty in the Swedish Constitution and Sweden's adoption of several international agreements—the petition thus resembles submission made in the recent Urgenda decision in the Netherlands. The petition argued that the sale would enable the expanded exploitation of lignite coal assets, resulting in emissions in excess of limits that correspond to climate stability. It further noted that Sweden committed to act to avoid breaching those limits. On this basis, the plaintiffs asked the court to declare that 1) the Swedish state has breached its duty of care with the sale, and 2) the sale is illegal. The plaintiffs have also asked the court to order publication of the environmental review conducted in advance of the sale, which the government has so far withheld.

Friends of the Earth & Others,United Kingdom,GBR,United Kingdom,[2012] EWCA Civ 28,Mitigation,<div>The Secretary of State appealed a parlimentary decision that a proposed modification to a law conducted was unlawful.</div>,,,Energy,Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change|government,Friends of the Earth & Ors.|ngo,,"01/01/2011|Case opened|Individuals, solar installation firms and community organizations coordinated by Friends of the Earth challenged the Secretary of State's decision to reduce the rate at which recipients of a FIT for solar would be compensated.;25/01/2012|Case decided|The Court concluded rates could be adjusted in prospect, making it permissible for the Secretary to reduce rates for installations coming online after April 1, 2012, but not in retrospect.","<div>In April 2010, the secretary of state for energy and climate change introduced a scheme to encourage the installation of generators for small-scale, low-carbon electricity generation (the scheme), including solar panels. The scheme required licensed electricity suppliers to pay a sum of money per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by such systems to the installer (the feed-in tariff). The original feed-in tariff was to be fixed for 25 years, subject to the Retail Prices Index (RPI). The scheme was established and came into effect pursuant to the Feed-in Tariffs (Specified Maximum Capacity and Functions Order) 2010, SI 2010/678 and by amendments to the standard licence conditions issued to electricity suppliers. The procedure for making modifications to the licence conditions in relation to the scheme was contained in section 42 of the Energy Act 2008. In October 2011, the secretary of state issued a consultation paper. The consultation period was due to expire on 23 December. The consultation paper proposed a reduction in the feed-in tariff payable for electricity generated by small solar systems. The proposed new tariffs were to come into force from 1 April 2012 (the reference date). The new tariff was also to apply to installations installed and certified on or before 12 December 2011. Therefore those installations would only receive the current tariff until 1 April 2012. The secretary of state's assessment of impact showed a potential reduction in uptake of small solar systems of 70% between 12 December 2011 and 1 April 2012. The claimants applied for judicial review of the proposal. The judge found that the scheme did not evince an intention on behalf of parliament to allow the secretary of state to make the proposed modification, and held that that modification was therefore unlawful. The secretary of state appealed. The issue was whether the judge had erred. Consideration was given to section 41 of the 2008 act. The appeal would be dismissed. The concept of a rate of payment fixed during the period of generation by reference to the date the installation became eligible for payment had been fundamental to the scheme. It had provided an assurance as to the rate of return to an owner who paid a capital sum before the installation coming into operation, subject to an adjustment in accordance with the RPI. That the scheme had provided for a fixed rate of return during the period of generation was a critical consideration. The structure of the scheme had fixed the rate by reference to the year the installation had became eligible for payment. It had not provided for a rate which might fluctuate according to the yearly decisions of the secretary of state, irrespective of the year when the installation became eligible. It was not possible to recognise in the standard licence conditions or elsewhere a scheme in which the tariffs might have varied, without regard to the date when the installation became eligible and without any indication within the scheme of what amount the owner of the installation might have received, or as to how it had to be calculated. The scheme had provided for a predetermined rate, not such rate as from time to time might have been determined. In those circumstances, a modification of the feed-in tariff payment rate, in respect of installations which had become eligible before the modification, would have a retrospective effect. Because the scheme had fixed a rate by reference to the year the installation had become eligible, reduction of that rate (apart from fluctuations in the RPI) would have had a retrospective effect. Therefore, such legislation would only have been valid if the empowering provision contained in section 41 of the 2008 act had authorised such an effect. However, on a proper construction, section 41 of the 2008 act contained no power to introduce a modification which reduced a fixed rate by reference to an installation becoming eligible before the modification. Accordingly, the secretary of state had had no power to make that modification.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The petitioners emphasized that Scottish National Heritage (SNH) had recommended against approval of the wind farm because of its adverse impacts, and that the Town & Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 requires the Ministers to consult with SNH and others. However, the Highland Council, the local planning authority, had concluded that the wind farm would have minimal impacts on view sheds. The court rejected the petitioners' arguments. It explained that the Ministers were not required to agree with the recommendations they received from consulting bodies, but only to explain their decision in full and to respond to points raised by consulting bodies if necessary.

It is not possible to appeal this decision.","<div>Plan B Earth, a charity with the mission to realize the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, has filed a climate change lawsuit against the Secretary of State for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (Secretary of State). Plan B Earth is joined in the lawsuit by 11 citizen claimants ranging in age from 9 to 79 who are impacted by climate change in a variety of ways. The claimants allege that the Secretary of State violated the Climate Change Act 2008 (the 2008 Act) and other law by failing to revise a 2050 carbon reduction target in light of new international law and scientific developments.<br><br>On December 8, 2017, the claimants filed a claim form and a document listing their grounds for judicial review at the High Court of Justice Administrative Court. They note that the 2008 Act set a carbon emissions reduction target for the year 2050 that is at least 80% lower than the aggregate total of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 (the 2050 target). This 2050 target was consistent with limiting average warming to 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. The claimants argue that the Secretary of State should make the 2050 target more ambitious to reflect scientific developments since 2008 and the Paris Agreement's intention to limit average warming to 1.5 degrees C. Under Section 2 of the 2008 Act, the Secretary of State has the authority to revise the target in light of scientific developments and international law.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Claimants present five grounds for seeking judicial review of the Secretary of State's failure to revise the 2050 target: (1) it is ultra vires, because it frustrates the legislative purpose of the 2008 Act; (2) it is based on an error of law regarding the objective of the Paris Agreement; (3) it is irrational, because it fails to take into account and / or inappropriately weighs considerations including the risks of global climate change and predictions of future technical innovation; (4) it violates the Human Rights Act 1998; and (5) it breaches the public sector equality duty set out in Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010.&nbsp;<br><br>Claimants seek declaratory relief that the Secretary of State acted unlawfully in violation of his responsibilities under the 2008 Act and a ""mandatory order that the Secretary of State revise the 2050 target in accordance with the purpose of the 2008 Act and the UK's international law obligations, ensuring, at a minimum, that the 2050 target commits the UK to an equitable contribution the Paris Agreement objective and that it conforms to the precautionary principle."" They also seek what other relief the court deems appropriate and costs.&nbsp;<br><br>In February, 2018, the claimants' application for judicial review was denied on all five grounds. The claimants renewed their application for review. On March 20, 2018, a permission hearing took place at the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand to determine if the case was strong enough to merit a full hearing. The hearing was adjourned after the Justice decided that the complexity of the issues would require a full-day permission hearing. The Justice also requested a more detailed statement from the Committee on Climate Change, an independent, statutory body established under the Climate Change Act 2008. The Committee is an interested party in the litigation.&nbsp;<br><br>On July 20, 2018, the High Court found the claims were not arguable and denied permission for the case to proceed. Plan B Earth appealed the decision on multiple grounds, including alleging that the judge misinterpreted Article 2(1)(a)of the Paris Agreement. Appellants argue that the judge incorrectly read this provision to allow for a range of ambition rather than holding the UK for responsible for ""[h]olding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels."" Accordingly, appellants further argue that the judge incorrectly found the current UK 2050 climate target compatible with the Paris Agreement due to this misinterpretation of required ambition.&nbsp;<br><br>On January 25, 2019, the Court of Appeal rejected Plan B's appeal of the High Court's denial to hear the case, marking the end of the appeal process. The court concluded that none of the 7 stated grounds had a real prospect of success. The court did not find an error in law in regard to an alleged failure to exercise discretion to amend the 2050 target, nor did the court find that the Secretary of State misunderstood the Paris Agreement or the advice of the Committee on Climate Change. While acknowledging that a governmental response to the need for environmental protection engages human rights in general, the court declined to find that relevant given its other findings that officials exercised proper discretion and understanding of the Paris Agreement and climate-related advice.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Additional claimants participated in the suit, but these two groups took lead on the climate-related claims.) Claimants argued that the Secretary's national policy statement supporting the expansion of Heathrow Airport violated the Planning Act 2008 (""the 2008 Act"") and the Human Rights Act 1998. The case went before the High Court of Justice Queen's Bench Division Administrative Court which refused all six climate change-related claims filed by the two environmental organisations.&nbsp;<br><br>Environmental Claimants argued that since the 2008 Act requires the Secretary to pursue the objective of sustainable development and consider the desirability of mitigating and adapting to climate change, it further gives rise to implicit obligations to consider the advice of the Committee on Climate Change (""the CCC""), the government's obligations under the Paris Agreement and commitment to review its national climate change targets in light of the Paris Agreement. Claimants maintained that the Secretary violated these implicit obligations by supporting the airport expansion without adequate consideration of the insufficiency of the current UK 2050 climate target (""2050 Target""), the UK's commitments under the Paris Agreement, the CCC's recommendations to review the 2050 Target, and government's recent agreement to review the 2050 Target. Accordingly, they asserted the Secretary's actions were both ultra vires and irrational. Plaintiffs additionally alleged violations of the Human Rights Act 1998. Claimants sought declaratory relief, specifically a declaration that the Secretary of State acted unlawfully in violation of section 5 of the 2008 Act.&nbsp;<br><br>The court did not find that the Secretary had any obligations to consider the Paris Agreement climate targets, the science underlying those climate targets, or a more stringent potential future climate target necessary for meeting the Paris Agreement. The court was not persuaded by arguments that the 2008 Act's climate action goals could be interpreted to make obligations under the Human Rights Act of 1998 inclusive of the Paris Agreement goals. The court found that the Secretary had fulfilled his obligations to consider existing domestic climate targets and acted within his discretion.&nbsp;<br><br>The Court of Appeal has granted plaintiffs the permission to appeal the lower court decision. The judge wrote that the ""[i]mportance of the issues raised in these and the related proceedings is obvious."" At the appeal hearing, which took place on October 21, 2019, Friends of the Earth reiterated their arguments that 1) the government was in breach of the sustainable development duty under section 10(3) of the Planning Act for not considering the Paris Agreement, the non-CO2 impacts and the long term impacts of the Airport National Policy Statement beyond 2050, and 2) the SoS acted unlawfully by omitting reference to international environmental protection objectives in the Appraisal of Sustainability as required by sch.2 of SEA regulations.<br><br>On February 27, 2020 the Court of Appeal reversed the lower court. The court concluded that the Government had made a commitment to the Paris Agreement goals a part of ""Government policy"" by the time the ANPS was prepared. The Secretary, as a result, needed to expressly consider and address the Paris Agreement goals during the ANPS process (but did not need to act in accordance with the Paris Agreement or reach any particular outcome). The court held that by failing to consider the Paris Agreement the Secretary violated the Planning Act and the requirement to undertake a strategic environmental assessment pursuant to EC Council Directive 2001/42/EC. The court therefore concluded that the ANPS is invalid and must be redone. The court further ruled that in completing a new ANPS, the Secretary should consider the non-carbon dioxide climate impacts of aviation and the effects of emissions beyond 2050, both of which had been omitted from the original analysis. The court did not find it necessary to quash the ANPS, but rather determined that the appropriate form of relief was a declaration that the decision to approve a new runway was unlawful and the ANPS may not have legal effect unless and until the Secretary undertakes a review of it in accordance with the Planning Act.<br><br>On May 6, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal. The UK Supreme Court overturned an appellate court decision, allowing the approval process for a third runway at Heathrow International Airport to move forward, on the grounds that the government sufficiently took into account climate impacts with regard to previous, less stringent, climate goals. The appellate court previously ruled that the government acted unlawfully by approving the expansion without considering the country's commitment to meeting the Paris Agreement goals.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The High Court quashed the denial on two grounds, including the Secretary's inadequate explanation of how preventing the project would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.


The Northumberland County Council granted planning permission to H. J. Banks & Co. Ltd for a surface mine for the extraction of coal, sandstone, and fireclay in the Highthorn area of southeast Northumberland. The Secretary called the application in for his own determination and after a public inquiry declined to grant permission for the project, giving considerable weight in his decision-making to the adverse effects of greenhouse gas emissions. H. J. Banks & Co. Ltd challenged the denial on two grounds. The first ground alleged an error in the Secretary's interpretation of balancing considerations under paragraph 149 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The second ground alleged that the Secretary wrongly weighed greenhouse gas emissions resulting from burning coal at power plants and that the Secretary acted inconsistently with previous practice in how the Secretary considered these emissions.


The High Court quashed the decision on grounds one and two. On ground one, the High Court determined that the Secretary had not lawfully weighed the relative costs and benefits of tourism and biodiversity as required under the balancing test of paragraph 149 of the NPPF and related regulations. On ground two, the High Court found that the Secretary provided insufficient reasoning to explain why emissions would be reduced if the coal project was denied because there was not adequate explanation of how power generation would be replaced by less carbon-intensive sources rather than imported coal. The Court found that the Secretary provided inadequate reasoning for how national policy to decarbonize was inconsistent with granting the permission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Administrative Court of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice quashed paragraph 209(a). Paragraph 209(a) instructed minerals planning authorities to recognize the benefits of developing oil and gas, including unconventional hydrocarbons, and to implement policies to facilitate their exploration and extraction. The court concluded that the Secretary of State for Housing and Communities and Local Government acted unlawfully by failing to undertake a proper public consultation or to account for recent evidence of the climate impacts of shale gas development.

Frackman argued that the Secretary had improperly failed to require an assessment of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions arising from the extended flow testing phase of the proposed project. The court disagreed, concluding that greenhouse gas emissions associated with exploration were fully assessed. Frackman also challenged the omission of any analysis of the indirect impacts of the succeeding production stage if the exploration proved the existence of a viable shale gas play. The court rejected this claim, reasoning that any possible future proposal would have to be considered on its own panning merits in light of a new environmental assessment. Finally, Frackman asserted that the Secretary was inconsistent in considering the potential benefits of natural gas in meeting the UK's planning goal of transitioning to a low-carbon future without assessing potential harms. The court dismissed this argument, concluding that the Secretary properly determined that shale gas exploration would help to achieve the objective of reducing carbon by establishing whether commercially viable natural gas existed on the sites in question.<br><br></div><div>The court dismissed both appeals in their entirety.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,

Pursuant to the EU ETS, Repsol received a free allocation of allowances for the period 2012-2017 based on a historic baseline assessment of CO2 emissions from Bleo Holm, and was required to surrender sufficient allowances to cover its total emissions each year, whether the free allowances or additional allowances that had been purchased. Following an investigation, the Offshore Production Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED) found that there had been a significant decrease in capacity at Bleo Holm and, as a result, determined that Repsol was not entitled to all of the free allowances that it had received. OPRED sought to recover the over-allocated allowances under the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Regulations 2012 on behalf of the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). OPRED is still investigating another significant capacity reduction issue which may have resulted in an over-allocation of allowances to Repsol.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>While the issues related to Repsol's allowances for 2013-2017 were under review, in December 2018, the European Commission decided to suspend the allocation of free allowances to UK operators in light of the uncertainties surrounding the UK's exit from the European Union. As a result, Repsol did not receive free allowances in 2018 as expected, and so the company had to purchase sufficient allowances to offset its emissions for that year.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In March 2019 Repsol appealed BEIS's Notice of Recovery, bringing three claims before the Tribunal General Regulatory Chamber. First, Repsol contended that BEIS should not have sought to recover the total number of allowances that had been over-allocated for 2012-2017, but rather, should have netted off the allowances that Repsol did not receive in 2018 due to the European Commission's decision to suspend the allocation of free allowances to UK operators. Second, Repsol argued that the European Commission's decision to withhold allowances from UK operators was unlawful. Third, Repsol claimed that by seeking recovery of allowances without netting off the allowances to which Repsol was entitled, BEIS violated Repsol's property rights under Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. Repsol asked the Tribunal to quash the Notice of Recovery.<br><br></div><div>On November 18, 2019, the Tribunal dismissed the appeal. According to the Tribunal's order, the parties agree there was an over-allocation of allowances as a result of Repsol's failure to notify BEIS of the decreased capacity at Bleo Holm, and so BEIS had the power to issue a Notice of Recovery. The Tribunal further explained that although a Notice of Recovery must provide certain information to an operator, this does not include the details of any calculation to determine the sum of allowances to which the operator is entitled. Therefore, the Tribunal reasoned, the sum of allowances does not include any netting-off calculation. Moreover, the 2012 regulations are intended to implement a strict accounting system. Given this, the Tribunal determined that BEIS did not err in declining to net off any allowances from the Notice of Recovery. The Tribunal further concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to re-interpret the European Commission's decision to suspend allowance allocations to UK operators or to declare the decision unlawful. Finally, the Tribunal held that it lacked the power to resolve Repsol's property rights claim.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to a press release issued by a barristers union, the complaint alleges, among other things, that the Secretary misinterpreted the Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy in assessing the project's greenhouse gas emissions; failed to properly assess the carbon-capture readiness of the facility; and did not consider the UK's mandate to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in a procedurally fair manner or, alternatively, failed to give adequate reasons for her assessment of the net zero target. The High Court gave ClientEarth permission to sue the government.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The High Court ruled for the defendants on May 22, 2020. The judge determined that the case involved policy questions requiring a balancing of interests, and that other public interests weigh against the UK's climate goals and for the plant's approval. These include the plant's contribution to security and diversity of energy supply. On July 21, 2020 the Court of Appeal granted ClientEarth leave to appeal the case.<br><br>On January 21, 2021, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision and rejected ClientEarth's appeal, finding that the government's approval of the plant was lawful. The Court of Appeal found that the Secretary of State balanced the adverse effects of the project, including greenhouse gas emissions, with the positive effects, including socioeconomic outcomes and re-use of existing infrastructure, and lawfully concluded that the benefits outweighed the adverse impacts. The Court of Appeal departed from the High Court in reasoning that greenhouse gas emissions are capable of being treated as ""a freestanding reason for refusal"" by the Secretary. Nevertheless, the Court reasoned that such emissions are not an ""automatic and insuperable obstacle"" to approval of infrastructure projects, and the decision-maker has discretion over the weight to assign to greenhouse gas emissions in approval decisions.<br><br>Drax decided in March 2021 to suspend the expansion in spite of the favourable judgment.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,

The claimaint sought an interim injunction to prevent imminent clearance works in six different woodlands. He brought a number of claims related to a report analyzing ""whether and how HS2 should proceed."" The claimant alleged, among other things, that the report failed to properly account for expected greenhouse gas emissions during construction of the project; and failed to address the project's effects on greenhouse gas emissions during the period leading up to 2050, and not just in 2050 and beyond, in accordance with the Paris Agreement and the Climate Change Act 2008. At an April 3 hearing, the court determined that claimant did not have a realistic prospect of success; on April 6 it issued written reasons for its decision. The court rejected all claims, including the claim based on greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The court first explained that the report at issue did adequately consider greenhouse gas emissions by assessing the short-term impacts of construction as well as the longer-term effects of providing a mode of transport that is less carbon-intensive than alternatives, such as aviation. The court also rejected the claimant's assertion that the report misrepresented a study by the project's ""nominated undertaker"" by failing to convey that construction emissions would not be at the ""low emissions"" end of the possible range, reasoning that the study simply gave a range of possible greenhouse gas emissions that the report fairly summarized. The court concluded that the defendants, therefore, did not fail to take into account a relevant factor that they were legally required to consider.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Second, the court dismissed the claimant's argument that both the report assessing H2S and the decision to approve the project failed to address the importance of greenhouse gas emissions in the period leading up to 2050, which is referred to in the Paris Agreement. The court reasoned that the report did consider the effects of the project before and after 2050 resulting from construction and the first 60 years of operation. The court distinguished Plan B Earth v. Secretary of State, in which the Secretary of State admitted that he had not considered the Paris Agreement in approving the expansion of Heathrow Airport.<br><br>On July 31, 2020, the Court of Appeal refused permission to appeal, reasoning that none of the claimant's claims were arguable.</div>",,,,,,,,,,,

The letter urged the Secretaries to consider whether the Energy NPSs are still appropriate under section 6(1) of the Planning Act 2008 in light of changed circumstances. These changed circumstances include an amendment to the Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment), in June 2019, to require that the UK achieves carbon neutrality by 2050; the Paris Agreement; the IPCC special report on 1.5 degrees of warming; the UK Parliament's declaration of a climate emergency; and the UK's exit from the European Union.

The plaintiffs argue that the events discussed above constitute a significant change in circumstances since the Energy NPSs were adopted in 2011, requiring review of the NPSs.

The plaintiffs seek a declaration that the government must review the Energy NPSs; or, alternatively, a declaration that the Energy NPSs are unlawful.
