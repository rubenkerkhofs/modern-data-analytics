Caveats:
"1. About county-level population estimates: population figures for 1981-1989 are intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident"
"population of the United States; population figures for 1990 are modified age-race-sex (MARS) April 1 census counts; population"
"figures for 1991-1999 are from the 1990-1999 series of bridged-race intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population;"
"population figures for 2000 and 2010 are bridged-race April 1 census counts; and population figures for 2001-2009 are from the"
"revised 2000-2009 series of bridged-race intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population."
"2. The number of heat wave days is computed at the county level, the summary totals show the number of heat wave days per county"
"per year. When the geographic area spans more than one county, an extreme heat event is counted for each county where measurable"
"observations that met the heat event definition occurred. Use caution when interpreting data representing aggregated counties."
